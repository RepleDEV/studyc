Chemical formulas shows the names of elements in a compound and how much of each of them there are. For example, the chemical formula of **butane**: $\ce{C4H10}$, which has **4 carbon atoms** and **10 hydrogen atoms**. 
## Empirical Formulas
Empirical formulas are formulas where the ratio of atoms are at their smallest value. For example, the empirical formula of **butane** would be: $\ce{C2H5}$.
## Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds are compounds consisting of ions, like for example, **sodium chloride**: $\ce{NaCl}$. The charges of an ionic compound must all add up to **zero**, or in other words be neutral. **Sodium**, $\ce{Na}$, which has a charge of **one**, is neutralized with **chlorine**, $\ce{Cl}$ ,which has a charge of **negative one**.

The charges of these elements could be deduced by their group and their series. **Metals** have **positive** charges according to their group (except for **transition metals**) and **reactive nonmetals** have **negative** charges according to their group as well. For **reactive nonmetals**, the farther the element is from the right, the **higher** the negative charge. 

> [!info] Hydrogen exception
> This is true for every **reactive nonmetal** except for **hydrogen**, which will only have a **positive charge**.
### Transition Metals
For transition metal elements, they could only have positive charge, but the charges aren't absolute. In other words, the charges vary, and when naming them, the name of the element is used, following their charge in roman numerals.

\ce{Iron(III) = Fe^3+}
$$
## Naming conventions
Understanding the names and how to get the chemical formula from *just* the name of the compound is quite helpful. For ionic compounds with two elements, it's simply the name of the **cation** (element with a positive charge) followed by the **anion** with a **-ide**. For example:
* **Sodium chloride**: $\ce{NaCl}$
* **Potassium sulfide**: $\ce{K2S}$
* **Magnesium oxide**: $\ce{MgO}$
### Acids
For compounds with **hydrogen** and any **reactive nonmetal** from group 17, they are called acids. For example: **hydrochloric acid**: $\ce{HCl}$. The naming convention is Hydro (from hydrogen) + {the anion}ic acid.
