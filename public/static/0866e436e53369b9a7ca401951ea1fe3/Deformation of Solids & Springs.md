When materials are deformed, they stretch or compress linearly. When they are stretched or compressed, they are under **stress** and **strain**. 

## Stress
Stress arises form materials receiving tensile force.
$$
\sigma=\frac{F}{A}
$$
Where $F$ is the force (perpendicular to the material's length, which defines a tensile force), and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the material.
## Strain
Strain is the ratio of the material's deformation to its original length.
$$
\epsilon=\frac{\Delta l}{l}
$$
## Young's modulus
Young's modulus is a quantity of the stiffness of a material, i.e., how much resistance a given material has to deformation.

Young's modulus is also the slope of a **stress** over **strain** graph.

Materials will deform linearly until it hits its proportional limit (point A in the graph), but it will continue to follow elastic behavior until its **elastic limit**.
* Elastic behavior: the behavior of materials where if forces are removed, they will **return to their original shape or form**
* Plastic behavior: the behavior where materials will **not** return to their original shape or form when their forces are removed.

## Hooke's law
Hooke's law applies to the deformation of springs, it states where springs (that follow proportionality), the force that they hold is proportional to its extension multiplied by the spring's **spring constant**.
$$
F=k\Delta x
$$
