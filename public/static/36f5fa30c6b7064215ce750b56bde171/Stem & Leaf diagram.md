A stem & leaf diagram is a way to represent small collections of **discrete** data. Usually, it works by having a **stem** in one side and having **leaves** to its right, with the stem being the **first digits** of the data and the leaves being the **last**.

For example:
```python
data = [1,2,3,4,5,10,12,23,25]
"""
Stem & Leaf:
0 | 1 2 3 4 5
1 | 0 2
2 | 3 5
"""
```
