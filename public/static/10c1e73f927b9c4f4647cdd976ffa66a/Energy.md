According to newton's **first law of thermodynamics**, it states that energy is **always conserved**, and it cannot be created nor destroyed. This essentially means that the total energy present (and accounted for) in a system will always be the same.

One example of energy is in **kinetic energy**.
$$
KE= \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
Kinetic energy represents the amount of energy of an object that is the result of it having velocity.

> One interesting note is the fact that $KE$ is the antiderivative (with respect to velocity) of momentum, $p = mv$.

Another form of energy is in the form of **gravitational potential energy**, which is the (potential) energy stored in an object from it gaining height.
$$
GPE = mgh
$$
The concept of energy is tied to the idea of [[Work & Power]], in that, it is the result of applying constant force over some distance. The amount of work put into a system will equal to the amount of energy it will have, be it in the form of **kinetic energy** or **potential energy**.
