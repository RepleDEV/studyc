A vector has **magnitude** and **direction**. Visually, vectors are like arrows. A vector's magnitude is how long or short the arrow is, and the direction is where it points to.
## Notation
Vectors are notated by the vector letters followed by an arrow above them.
$$
\overrightarrow{a}
$$
## Sums of vectors
Vectors, when added together, equals to the vectors being added, joined from head to tail.

#### Subtracting
Subtracting is similar. It's like joining $a$ with $b$ pointing to the opposite direction.

## Numerical Notation
Vectors can simply be notated by using the **cartesian coordinate system**, and is specified with a tuple of each of the components $(x, y, z)$.
### Ordered set Notation
Any $n$-dimensional vector **v** can be notated as:
$$
\textbf{v} = (v_1,v_2,\dots,v_{n-1},v_n)
$$
### Matrix Notation
Vectors are also defined as being **one dimensional matrices**.
$$
v=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_{n-1} \\ v_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$
### Unit vector notation
A vector in 3 or fewer dimensions can be defined using the sum of scalar multiples of unit vectors.
$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{v} = 
v_x \hat{\textbf{i}} +
v_y \hat{\textbf{j}} +
v_z \hat{\textbf{k}}
\end{align*}
$$
### Polar coordinate notation
Two dimensional vectors can also be represented as the magnitude and direction in a set.
* The **magnitude** typically represented as $r$ is the distance from the origin. (Can be remembered as $r$ for radius)
* and angle, measured counterclockwise, represented as $\theta$ (Greek letter **theta**).
