Given an absolute function $f(x)$, it is defined as: $f(-x) = f(x)$, or: 
$$
f(x) = |x| =
\begin{cases}
x & \text{if} & x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if} & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Simply put, given any input $x$, $|x|$ will **always** output the positive sign of $x$. Another way of describing the absolute function is that it gives the distance of any number from the origin.
## Equations
From this, we can deduce that: $|x| = c$ (where both $x$ and $c$ are real numbers) will have two solutions $x =\pm c$. This is true for any $x$. 

For equations with two functions, $|f(x)| = g(x)$ it is important to check your answers as one or more answers may be invalid. 

We can also deduce that:
$$
|x|^2 = x^2
$$
Since, analogously, $|x| = \sqrt{x^2}$.

From here, we can deduce that: 
$$
\begin{align*}
|f(x)| &= |g(x)| \\
f(x)^2&=g(x)^2
\end{align*}
$$
## Inequalities
It is helpful to realize that:
$$
|a| \le b \Leftrightarrow -b \leq a \leq b
$$
and
$$
|a| \geq b \Leftrightarrow a \geq b \text{ or } a \leq -b
$$
