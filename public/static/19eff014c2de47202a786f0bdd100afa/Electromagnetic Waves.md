An electromagnetic wave is a wave made up of a moving oscillating **electric** and **magnetic** field, which are oscillating perpendicular to each other, and are both perpendicular to the electromagnetic wave's direction. 

Electromagnetic waves are always around us, being used in various different ways, such as:
* Radios
* Microwaves
* Phone signals
* Visible light
* x-rays

Electromagnetic waves travel (in a vacuum, but, generally) at the speed of light, $c$, where it is roughly defined as:
$$
c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ ms}^{-1}
$$
## Electromagnetic Waves in the real world
**Please fill this in :D**
## Polarization
EM waves could be either **polarized** or **unpolarized**. Polarized waves are only oscillating at a **specific angle**. Unpolarized light can be polarized using a polarizing filter, and polarized light can be repolarized or absorbed completely using the same filter.

### The effect of a polarizing filter to polarized waves
Polarized waves when passing through a polarizing filter, will be absorbed by a factor of $\cos^2(\theta)$ of the angle of the polarized light relative to the angle of the polarized filter. Polarized waves will be polarized to the angle of the polarizing filter.
### Formula derivation
Waves oscillate up and down. If we take one wave at one specific time where the wave has maximum displacement, we can think of the wave as a vector angled at $\theta$ (relative to the filter) with length of its amplitude $A$. 

For example, let's say we have a wave of amplitude $A$ of $1$ and an angle $\theta$ of $30^\circ$ to the horizontal (relative to the filter). The amount of the wave that will pass through will be the horizontal component of the wave, $A_f = A_i \times \cos(30^\circ)$. Because the intensity of a wave is proportional to the **square** of its amplitude, we get:
$$
I_f = I_i \times \cos^2(30^\circ)
$$
### Polarizing filter on unpolarized waves
On unpolarized waves, the waves will pass through and be polarized to the direction of the polarized filter. The intensity of the wave will be decreased by **half** of its original intensity.
## Diffraction
Electromagnetic waves when passing through a tiny slit or aperture goes through a phenomenon called **diffraction**, in that the waves *diffract* outwards after passing through the slit. The tinier the slit, the more the waves diffract.
