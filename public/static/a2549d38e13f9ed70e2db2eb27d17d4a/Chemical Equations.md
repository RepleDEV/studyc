Chemical equations are analogous to mathematical equations, but instead of adding up numbers, we're combining **elements** and **compounds** together. For example:
$$
\ce{H2 + O2 -> H2O}
$$
Here, we have **hydrogen** reacting with **oxygen** to make **water**.
## Balancing Equations
Balancing an equation is a critical first-step to [[Stoichiometry]]. Balancing an equation simply means making sure that in both sides of an equation, there are the same amount of atoms present of each element. Balancing the equation earlier, we get:
$$
\ce{2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O}
$$
This way, we can now say that for every $n$ moles of **hydrogen** that we have, we must have $\frac{1}{2}n$ moles of **oxygen** to not have any **excess reactant** when doing the reaction.
## Limiting reactant/reagent
A **limiting reactant** is a reactant that **limits** the amount of product yield unless increased. For example: from the equation earlier, we have $3$ moles of **hydrogen** and $4$ moles of oxygen. In this case, if we used up all of our hydrogen, we would only use up $\frac{3}{2}$ moles of oxygen. No matter how much more oxygen we put in, we (theoretically) can't get any more water than $3$ moles. In this case, the **hydrogen** is a **limiting reactant**, with $\frac{5}{2}$ moles of **excess oxygen**.
