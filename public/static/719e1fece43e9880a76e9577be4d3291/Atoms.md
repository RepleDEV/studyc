Atoms are the building blocks of our universe. It is built upon **protons**, **electrons**, and **neutrons**. The anatomy of an atom consists of a very large mass in the center, made of protons and neutrons, called the **nuclei**, with electrons **orbiting** the nuclei, and empty space in between.

The most abundant element in the world, **[[Hydrogen]]**, has **one proton** with **one electron**. An atom with **one proton** **MUST** be a **Hydrogen** atom. The **amount** of protons an atom has defines the atom.
## Subatomic particles
Atoms are made out of **subatomic particles**, those being: 
* **Protons**: subatomic particles with a **charge** of **+1**
* **Neutrons**: subatomic particles with **no charge**
* **Electrons**: subatomic particles with **-1 charge** 
## Ions
Ions are atoms with a **net charge**. Atoms are made up of equal amounts of **protons** and **electrons**, but ions have differing amounts. Atoms with **more** electrons will have a **net negative charge**. 
* **Cation**: (pronounced cat ion /ᐠ - ˕ -マ Ⳋ) positively charged ion
* **Anion**: (pronounced an ion) negatively charged ion.
## Isotopes
An atom's isotopes are different versions of atoms with differing amounts of **neutrons**. 
## Atomic mass units
Atomic mass units are used as a unit of mass for the [[Masses of Atoms]] of atoms, and subatomic particles. One atomic mass units is defined to be **1/12 of a carbon-12 atom**. Protons and neutrons both have an atomic mass unit of one, but electrons have an atomic mass unit of 1/1838, which is why electrons isn't measured as part of an atom's mass.
## Relative atomic mass
The mass of an atom is the average mass of the atom's stable isotopes. [[Masses of Atoms|See more]].
## Notation
Atoms are notated by their element name, a left subscript denoting their atomic number, a left superscript denoting their nuclei number (the sum of the amounts of protons and neutrons), and a right superscript denoting their charge (if any).
