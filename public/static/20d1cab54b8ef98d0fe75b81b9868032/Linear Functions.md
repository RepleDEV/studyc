Linear functions are functions where the graph shows a straight line.
$$f(x)=y = mx+b$$
Here, the $x$ variable has a coefficient of $m$, which is a constant. $m$ is also the [[Slope||slope]] of the function. $b$, which is also a constant, is the **y-intercept** of the function.
## Slope-intercept form
This is the most common form of a linear equation.
$$
y=mx+b 
$$
## Point-slope form
In this form, $m$ is the slope, and $(a, b)$ is a point the line passes through.
$$ y-b=m(x-a) $$
The origins of this form come from a [[Notes/Math/Topics/Functions#Translation|function translation]] where the function is translated to $(a, b)$ 
## Standard form
$$ax+by=c$$
Here, the slope is:
$$
m = -\frac{a}{b}
$$
And the y-intercept can be solved by plugging $x=0$ which results to:
$$
y=\frac{c}{b}
$$
