The equilibrium constant gives us some insight to the concentrations given in a [[Reversible Reactions|reversible reaction]].  It is symbolized as $K_c$.

Given this equation:
$$
\ce{aA + bB <=> cC + dD}
$$
Its equilibrium constant would be:
$$
K_c = \frac
{
[C]^c \times [D]^d
}
{
[A]^a \times [B]^b
}

$$
For calculating equilibrium constants (in a reversible reaction) (and for whatever reason), **any solids** are **ignored** in the calculation.
## Gaseous Reactions
In gaseous reactions, $K_p$ can be calculated given the elements' partial pressures. Such as the **equilibrium constant** for the reaction for **ammonia**:
$$
\ce{N2 + 3H2 <=> 2NH3}
$$
