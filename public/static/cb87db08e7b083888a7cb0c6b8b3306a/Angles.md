Angles are the measure of the space between two intersecting lines, as in how much is there in between a corner of two walls.

Angles can be represented in either degrees or radians. To turn a full circle, one must needs to turn $360^\circ$ (360 degrees) to do a full turn. In radians, $360^\circ$ would be $2\pi$ radians.

>It is also to be acknowledged that an angle of $0$ is as if a clock facing towards the third hour, and as the angle increases, it rotates **counter-clockwise**.
## Angular equivalence
Say you rotate yourself in-place for a full turn. You will have turned a full $360^\circ$. If you do that again, you will have rotated yourself $720^\circ$. Except, you're still facing the same direction. This concept is called **angular equivalence**. It is how with any angle $\theta$, it is equivalence to a full turn above or below $\theta$.

\theta\cong\theta+360^\circ\times n
