The unit for atomic mass: **atomic mass units**, is measured relative to one twelfth of a **carbon-12** atom. A **carbon-12** atom has a total of 12 particles in its nuclei (sum of protons and neutrons), each are measured to be **one** atomic mass units. 

So the **relative** atomic mass of a **carbon-12** atom is (roughly) 12 u (12 atomic mass units).

It is only a rough estimate because the masses for atoms are measured according to the relative abundances of the element's naturally occurring isotopes.
$$
\ce{A_{r}}=\sum_{}^{}M_i\times A_i
$$
## Isotopic abundance
An element can have many different naturally occurring isotopes, and each of those isotopes has their own abundances, as in, **how much** of any sized sample of an atom is of a specific isotope of that atom. This abundance number is measured using a **mass spectrometer**. 
## Relative molecular mass
**Relative molecular mass** is the **relative mass** of a molecule, which is calculated by summing the relative **atomic** masses of the individual elements.
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{M_r H2O &= A_r H\times 2 + A_r O}\\
\ce{&=18}
\end{align*}
$$
## Moles
A **mole** is a certain quantity of atoms which results in *"for every mole of an atom, it will result in the atom's relative atomic mass, but in grams"*. So **one mole** of **carbon**, which has a relative atomic mass of **12 u**, will be equal to **12 grams** of carbon. This also works for molecules, just with their relative **molecular** mass.

This "certain quantity" of atoms is called the **Avogadro's constant**, which is equal to:
$$
\ce{Na = 6.022 \times 10^23}
$$
