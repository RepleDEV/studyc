An electric field is a vector field of a region in space in which charged particles experience forces. For a small positively charged particle ${q}$ experiencing a force within an electric field, its *electric field strength* is defined as the force per unit charge, namely:
$$
E = \frac{F}{q}
$$
For an isolated, **positively** charged particle the electric field generated from it will be radially *outwards* from the charged particle, however for a **negatively** charged particle, the field will be radially *inwards*. Consequentially, when two oppositely charged particles are placed in close proximity, they will be attracted towards each other. Meanwhile, for same charged particles, they will repel each other.

## Uniform Electric Fields
A uniform electric field can be created by having two charged plates.

The field strength throughout is defined as the change in potential difference between the two plates, and the distance between the plates:
$$
E = \frac{\Delta V}{d}
$$
## Coulomb's Law
Coulomb's law takes a similar form to the force of [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Gravity|Gravity]] to define the force between two point charges in free space.
$$
F = k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
$$
Where $k_e$ is the coulomb's constant, or constant of proportionality, defined as:
$$
k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}
$$
Where $\varepsilon_0$ is the *electric permittivity* in a vacuum.

Revising the electric field strength formula, we get the strength for an isolated particle charged $q$ at a distance $r$:
$$
E = k_e\frac{q}{r^2}
$$
We also get that:
$$
F =qE
$$
## Electric Potential Energy
The electric potential energy is defined as the negative work required to move a charged particle in a uniform electric field from infinity to a point.
$$
U_E(r) = -\int_\infty^r qE\space ds=k_e\frac{qQ}{r}
$$
## Electric Potential
Electric potential or the electric field potential is the amount of energy required per unit of electric charge to move it from a reference point to a specific point in an electric field.
$$
V_E(r) = \frac{U_E(r)}{q}=k_e\frac{Q}{r}
$$
