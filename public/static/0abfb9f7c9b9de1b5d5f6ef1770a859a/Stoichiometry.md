Stoichiometry is the calculation of ratios of moles of compounds in a chemical equation. For example, this is the balanced equation of the combustion of **butane**:
$$
\ce{2C4H10 + 13O2 -> 8CO2 + 10H2O}
$$
Here, in this case, we can say that for every **two moles** of **butane**, we get **8 moles** of **carbon dioxide** and **10** moles of **water**. This relationship can be used to calculate the moles of the product given any mole $n$ of any reactant.

This is one of the reasons why [[Chemical Equations#Balancing Equations||balancing your equations]] is critical to **stoichiometry**, as if the equation isn't balanced, then all calculations will be inaccurate.
