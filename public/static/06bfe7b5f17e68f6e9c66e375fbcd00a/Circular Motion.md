The kinematics of circular motion describes the motion of systems with rotation, such as a wheel. The kinematics of circular motion can be used to describe the *linear speed* of a rotating wheel. All equations circle around $\omega$, representing the **rate of change** of the rotating wheel's angle.
$$
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$
Given the equation for [[Circular Measure#Arc|arc length]], we can see that the distance traveled of $s$ of $\theta$ is given as:
$$
s(\theta) = r\theta
$$
To find velocity we can conclude that:
$$
\frac{ds}{dt} = v=\frac{ds}{d\theta} \cdot \frac{d\theta}{dt} = r\omega
$$
## Centripetal Acceleration
For any object to follow a circular motion, it must have **centripetal acceleration**. Given a position vector $\vec{s}$ denoting the position of an object following a constant circular motion and its velocity $\vec{v}$ denoting its velocity, which is perpendicular to $\vec{s}$. After a small change in time $\Delta t$, the position of $\vec{s}$ must change by an angle $\Delta\theta$ relative to the origin of the motion. The angle between the change in $\vec{v}$ must also be $\Delta\theta$. 

Since the position vector is of constant length relative to the origin, the magnitude of the velocity is also constant, and the angle between the initial vectors and the vectors after time $\Delta t$ are equal, therefore they must form congruent triangles.
$$
\frac{|\Delta\vec{v}|}{v}=\frac{|\Delta\vec{r}|}{r}
$$
We can then substitute $|\Delta\vec{v}|$ to the formula of acceleration:
$$
a = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{|\Delta\vec{v}|}{\Delta t}
=\frac{v}{r}\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{|\Delta\vec{r}|}{\Delta t}
=\frac{v^2}{r}=\omega^2r
$$

For acceleration, it is important to understand that for *linear* circular motion, the acceleration only changes the **direction** of the velocity. For an object that moves in circular motion, it can be visualized that the *velocity* is a [[Notes/Math/Topics/Vectors|vector]] that spins around tangentially. 

Given that an object moving in circular motion completes a single revolution within a time period $T$, assuming constant angular velocity, it can be defined as:
$$
\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}
$$
