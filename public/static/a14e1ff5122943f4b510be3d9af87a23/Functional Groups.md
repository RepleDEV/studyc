Functional groups of organic compounds are a way of organizing organic compounds depending on their chemical structure and arrangement.
## Alkanes
Alkanes are recognized by their carbon-carbon single bonds (C-C), with each carbon atom also connected to three **hydrogen** atoms.

They have a chemical formula of $\ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}$, they are non polar and flammable, such as any other hydrocarbon.
### Alkane Reactions
Alkanes react with oxygen ($\ce{O2}$) to **make carbon dioxide and water**, creating a **combustion** reaction.
$$
\ce{2C8H18 + 25O2 -> 16CO2 + 18H2O}
$$
If insufficient oxygen is provided, **carbon monoxide** will be made instead.

They can undergo substitution with a **halogen** under *UV light* to make a **halogenoalkane**. ^c63777
$$
\ce{C2H6 + Br2 -> CH3CH2Br + HBr}
$$

^3e841d

Alkanes can also undergo a *free radical substitution* with a halogen, with its first step, the **initiation** step, being the splitting of a diatomic halogen atom with UV light. This then created two atoms of that halogen with each having one **free radical**.
$$
\ce{Cl2 -> 2Cl\cdot}
$$
Next, **propagation** steps occur with a halogen atom reacting with an alkane. The chlorine would steal a hydrogen atom from the alkane, creating an acid and another radical.
$$
\ce{CH3CH3 + Cl\cdot -> \cdot CH2CH3 + HCl}
$$
This alkyl radical can then react with diatomic molecules of chlorine, reacting to get a halogenoalkane.
$$
\ce{\cdot CH2CH3 + Cl2 -> CH3CH2Cl + Cl\cdot}
$$
The free radical molecules created will then continue to react until we get to the **termination step** where two free radical atoms react.
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{\cdot CH2CH3 + Cl\cdot &-> ClCH2CH3}\\
\ce{\cdot CH2CH3 + \cdot CH2CH3 &-> CH3CH2CH2CH3}
\end{align*}
$$
## Alkenes
Alkenes are recognized by their **carbon double bond** (C=C). They are non polar and are also flammable.
### Alkene Reactions
Alkenes can undergo addition with hydrogen to form an alkane with the presence of a catalyst, usually *platinum* or *nickel*.
$$
\ce{CH2=CH2 + H2 -> CH3CH3}
$$
They could also undergo **hydration** with water to form an alcohol with the presence of an acid, such as Phosphoric acid ($\ce{H3PO4}$).
$$
\ce{CH2=CH2 + H2O ->[H3PO4] CH3CH2OH}
$$

They also undergo **electrophilic** addition with a hydrogen halide to form a [[Functional Groups#Halogenoalkanes|halogenoalkane]].
$$
\ce{CH2=CH2 + HBr -> CH3CH2Br}
$$

^9d8dc9


This is due to the fact that the hydrogen in a hydrogen halide has a *slightly* positive charge, thus, this slightly positive charge can attack the carbon double bond present in the alkene, which represents an *electron rich* environment. One of the carbon atoms will then bond with the hydrogen atom, leaving the other having a slightly positive charge, free to bond with the bromine ion.
$$
\ce{CH2=CH2 + H+ + Br- -> CH3C+HCH3 + Br- -> CH3CHBrCH3}
$$
Alkenes can also react with a diatomic halogen molecule.
$$
\ce{CH2=CH2 + Br2 -> BrCH2CH2Br}
$$

^7c2e65

As the bromine molecule approaches the carbon double bond, the electrons in the electron rich double bond repels the electrons shared by the bromine atoms, creating an *induced dipole moment*, making them polar. A slightly positive and a slightly negative bromine atom is now present, with the positive bromine atom attacking the carbon double bonds.
$$
\ce{CH2=CH2 + Br+ + Br- -> CH2BrC+H2 + Br- -> BrCH2=CH2Br}
$$

Alkenes also undergo **oxidation** with water under the presence of cold, dilute *potassium permanganate* ($\ce{KMnO4}$) to form a **diol**.
$$
\ce{CH2=CH2 + H2O -> HOCH2=CH2OH}
$$
## Halogenoalkanes
Halogenoalkanes are basically alkanes with one of the hydrogen atoms replaced by a **halogen**. Because of the added halogen they are polar. They are less flammable than alkanes.
### Synthesizing halogenoalkanes
Simplest way to synthesize a halogenoalkane is by substitution of an alkane, as stated [[Functional Groups#^3e841d|previously]]. Or with an addition reaction with a [[Functional Groups#^9d8dc9|hydrogen halide]] and an alkene, or with a [[Functional Groups#^7c2e65|diatomic halogen molecule]].

An alcohol may be substituted with a hydrogen halide to create a halogenoalkane.
$$
\ce{CH3CH2OH + HCl -> CH3CH2Cl + H2O}
$$
Or a phosphorus halide (also works with $\ce{PBr3}$ and $\ce{PBr5}$):
$$
\begin{align*}
\ce{3CHCH2OH + PCl3 &->[heat] 3CH3CH2Cl + H3PO4}\\
\ce{CH3CH2OH + PCl5 &-> CH3CH2Cl + HCl + POCl3}
\end{align*}
$$
Lastly with $\ce{SOCl2}$.
$$
\ce{CH3CH2OH + SOCl2 -> CH3CH2Cl + HCl + SO2}  
$$
### Halogenoalkane reactions
Firstly, a halogenoalkane can go through an elimination reaction to turn it into an **alkene**, using **ethanolic sodium hydroxide**.
$$
\ce{CH3CH2Br + NaOH ->[ethanol][heat] CH2CH2 + H2O + NaBr}
$$
They can also undergo $S_N2$ *nucleophilic substitution* with aqueous sodium hydroxide, turning it back to an alcohol.
$$
\ce{CH3CH2Br + NaOH -> CH3CH2OH + NaBr}
$$

>Tertiary halogenoalkanes undergo $S_N1$ *nucleophilic substitution*.

They also react with ethanolic **potassium cyanide** to form a nitrile.
$$
\ce{CH3CH2Br + KCN ->[ethanol][heat under reflux] CH3CH2CN + KBr}
$$
They can also react with ethanolic **ammonia** to form an amine.
$$
\ce{CH3CH2Br + NH3 -> CH3CH2NH2 + HBr}
$$
## Alcohols
Alcohols contain the $\ce{R-OH}$ functional group. They are polar, and flammable.
### Synthesizing Alcohols
They can undergo addition from an alkene, as stated [[Functional Groups#^6574d2|here]].
