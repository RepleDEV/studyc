In mixtures of ideal gases, its total pressure is equal to the sum of the **partial pressures** of each of the individual gases. 

For example, this reaction of **nitrogen** ($\ce{N2}$), **hydrogen** ($\ce{H2}$), and **ammonia** ($\ce{NH3}$).
$$
\ce{N2 + 3H2 <=> 2NH3}
$$
In this case, the total pressure would be:
$$
p = p_{\ce{N2}} + p_{\ce{H2}} + p_{\ce{NH3}}
$$
These partial pressures are also used to calculate the [[Equilibrium Constant]] for **gaseous reversible reactions**.
