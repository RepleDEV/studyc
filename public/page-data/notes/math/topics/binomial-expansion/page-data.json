Fortunately there is a pattern to this, for example, here is the expanded polynomial for $n = 2$ and $n = 3$.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(a+b)^{2}&= a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\\\\\n(a+b)^{3}&= a^{3}+3a^{2}b+3ab^{2}+b^{3}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nNotice the exponents for $a$ and $b$. As the equation goes further to the right, the exponent of $a$ decreased from $n$ to $0$, and it is the opposite for $b$.\n\nFor the coefficients form the **pascal's triangle**. A triangle that is formed with the summation of the two above numbers. As in:\n* 1\n* 1 2 1\n* 1 3 3 1\n* 1 4 6 4 1\n* 1 5 10 10 5 1\n* 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\nAny number in this triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it, and these numbers forms the coefficient for the $k$'th term of the binomial expansion.\n\nThe formula for the $k$'th term of the expansion is actually the [[Combinations & Permutations#]].\n$$\n^{n}C_{k}={n\\choose k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\\times k!}\n$$\nAll in all, the combination formula can actually be written as:\n$$\n(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\n {n \\choose k}a^{n-k}\\times b^k\n}\n$$\n"}},"allSitePage":{"nodes":[{"path":"/","pageContext":{}},{"path":"/notes/chemistry/chemistry/","pageContext":{"id":"66e96553-ebac-5831-aeb9-360c7670f19b","relativeDirectory":"Chemistry","name":"Chemistry","__params":{"relativeDirectory":"chemistry","name":"chemistry"}}},{"path":"/notes/english/english/","pageContext":{"id":"92f53d15-a967-5f8d-abf2-8dc0fcb52900","relativeDirectory":"English","name":"English","__params":{"relativeDirectory":"english","name":"english"}}},{"path":"/notes/physics/physics/","pageContext":{"id":"d957898e-66eb-5772-8c64-8664bb9c2633","relativeDirectory":"Physics","name":"Physics","__params":{"relativeDirectory":"physics","name":"physics"}}},{"path":"/notes/math/math/","pageContext":{"id":"b926139a-b1ad-5fb2-b9cb-3b4c20520f6e","relativeDirectory":"Math","name":"Math","__params":{"relativeDirectory":"math","name":"math"}}},{"path":"/notes/chemistry/topics/chemical-equations/","pageContext":{"id":"4551862f-b308-5d01-b364-1909dbdda934","relativeDirectory":"Chemistry/Topics","name":"Chemical
