Since it has no coefficients the factors would be two $x$'s.\nNext, is finding the factor(s) for $c$. There are multiple factors this time, and they are:\n* $1 \\times 54$\n* $2 \\times 27$\n* $3 \\times 18$\n* $6 \\times 9$\n\nThe next step is to try one of the factors and write it out in this format:\n![[Pasted image 20230718102416.png]]\nNotice the factors for $x^2$ on the left side of the cross, and (one) of the factors of $54$ on the other side. The cross denotes the direction of the products to sum to find $b$. Thus:\n![[Pasted image 20230718102710.png]]\nHere we can see that the sum is equals to $b$ which is $15x$. Which means that the factors for the polynomial is:\n$$\n(x+6)(x+9)\n$$\n> [!tip]\n> Instead of writing down every cross multiplication combination, try doing it in your head first, then write it down to check.\n\n >[!note]\n >In the case that $b$ is negative with $a$ and $c$ being positive, the two factors of $c$ must both be negative.\n## Higher order polynomials\nWith higher order polynomials, the process is more or less the same.\nFor example:\n$$\n4x^8 + 28x^5 +48x^2\n$$\nFirst, to make it easy, try to make the last term be a constant.\n$$\n4x^2(x^6+28x^3+48)\n$$\nThen, cross multiply the polynomial inside the parentheses and factorize.\n![[Pasted image 20230718103816.png]]\nAnd finally, we have:\n$$\n4x^2(x^3+3)(x^3+4)\n$$\n## [[Polynomial Identities]]\nUsing polynomial #Identities can also be a quick way to factorize polynomials.\n> [!done] Conclusion \n> * Factorize using #cross_multiplication \n> * Find factors of $a$ and $c$ where the sum of products is equal to $b$\n> * Use [[Polynomial Identities]] when applicable\n\n^efe2cf\n"}},"allSitePage":{"nodes":[{"path":"/","pageContext":{}},{"path":"/notes/chemistry/chemistry/","pageContext":{"id":"66e96553-ebac-5831-aeb9-360c7670f19b","relativeDirectory":"Chemistry","name":"Chemistry","__params":{"relativeDirectory":"chemistry","name":"chemistry"}}},{"path":"/notes/math/math/","pageContext":{"id":"b926139a-b1ad-5fb2-b9cb-3b4c20520f6e","relativeDirectory":"Math","name":"Math","__params":{"relativeDirectory":"math","name":"math"}}},{"path":"/notes/physics/physics/","pageContext":{"id":"d957898e-66eb-5772-8c64-8664bb9c2633","relativeDirectory":"Physics","name":"Physics","__params":{"relativeDirectory":"physics","name":"physics"}}},{"path":"/notes/english/english/","pageContext":{"id":"92f53d15-a967-5f8d-abf2-8dc0fcb52900","relativeDirectory":"English","name":"English","__params":{"relativeDirectory":"english","name":"english"}}},{"path":"/notes/math/topics/absolute-functions/","pageContext":{"id":"a30cd64d-1081-5460-bf67-3da7abd9d4fb","relativeDirectory":"Math/Topics","name":"Absolute
