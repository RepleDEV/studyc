Measuring central tendency, or otherwise known as the **average**, usually involves these three:
* **Mode**: the most commonly occurring value
* **Mean**: calculated by the sum of the values divided by the number of values (arithmetic mean)
* **Median**: the middle value of an ordered set of data

## Mode
This is the simplest of all measures of central tendency, as it measures the most commonly occurring value in a set of data.
### Modal Class
**Modal class** is a term used for grouped data which determines the **mode** of a class in grouped data. The modal class is determined by a class's **frequency** density.
$$
\text{frequency density} = \frac{\text{frequency}}{\text{class width}}
$$
The class with the highest frequency density will be the modal class.
## Mean
With mean, the most widely used type is the **arithmetic** mean with the other being the **geometric** mean. Arithmetic mean is as simple as taking the sum of the values divided by the number of values, and it is denoted by a bar over a variable.
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum{x}}{n_x}
$$
## Mean estimate in grouped data
With grouped data, we don't have access to the original values of the data, as such, only an estimate of the mean can be determined. Since the data is grouped into classes, with only the frequency of the class given, we can determine an estimate for the sum of data of a particular class by taking the sum of the **midpoint** of the class multiplied by the frequency.

The **midpoint** (which is taken by taking half of the distance between the **upper** bound and the **lower** bound of the class) is taken as it represents the best estimate for a value within that class.
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum{xf}}{\sum{f}}
$$
## Median
**Median** is the **middle** value of a set of data. This is also the same as the **50th** [[percentile]].
## The right type of central tendency
While it is tempting to just use mean as the central tendency for everything, it is also important to consider what the values in a data set are. Data with **outliers** may affect the data's mean, especially those who are very var away from the rest of the data. In this case, it may be more appropriate to use the **median** as a central tendency as it is **less affected by extreme values**.
