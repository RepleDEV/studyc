Measuring central tendency, or otherwise known as the **average**, usually involves these three:
* **Mode**: the most commonly occurring value
* **Mean**: calculated by the sum of the values divided by the number of values
* **Median**: the middle value of an ordered set of data

## Mode
This is the simplest of all measures of central tendency, as it measures the most commonly occurring value in a set of data.
