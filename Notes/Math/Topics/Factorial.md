Factorial is the notation used for **decrementing** multiplication.
$$
n!=\prod_{k=1}^{n}{n-(k-1)}
$$
>[!info] Pi
>The big twin-column symbol is **pi** used as **product notation**, where the term is multiplied by itself as k increases from its initial value (in this case, $1$) to $n$. 

For example:
$$
6!=6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1
$$
A property of factorials is that dividing factorials with factorials results to:
$$
\frac{a!}{(a-k)!}=\prod_{i=a-k}^{a}{a-(i-1)}
$$
## $0!$
The factorial of 0 is equals to $1$ interestingly. This might seem counterintuitive as there are no numbers below $0$? Although, this fact is equivalent to $n^0=1$. If
