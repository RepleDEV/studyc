Angles are the measure of the space between two intersecting lines, as in how much is there in between a corner of two walls.

Angles can be represented in either degrees or radians. To turn a full circle, one must needs to turn $360^\circ$ (360 degrees) to do a full turn.
## Radian definition
1 radian is defined as the angle formed when an arc length is drawn where the length of said arc is equal to the radius. To put it simply, given a circle with radius of $1$, and an arc length of the same length, the angle for said arc length is **equal to 1 radian**.

Given that the [[Notes/Math/Topics/Circular Measure|circumference]] of a circle is defined as $2\pi \times r$, if $r=1$ therefore its circumference is equal to $2\pi$. From here, we can see that the angle that makes a full circle is (also) equal to $2\pi$ radians.

>It is also to be acknowledged that an angle of $0$ is as if a clock facing towards the third hour, and as the angle increases, it rotates **counter-clockwise**.
## Angular equivalence
Say you rotate yourself in-place for a full turn. You will have turned a full $360^\circ$. If you do that again, you will have rotated yourself $720^\circ$. Except, you're still facing the same direction. This concept is called **angular equivalence**. It is how with any angle $\theta$, it is equivalent to a full turn above or below $\theta$.

\theta\cong\theta+360^\circ\times n
