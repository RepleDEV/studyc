Data can be **qualitative** or **quantitative**.
### Qualitative
Qualitative data is any kind of data that **isn't countable**. For example, a group of people's favorite colors.
### Quantitative

### Discrete & Continuous
Qualitative data is either **discrete** or **continuous** where **discrete** data is data where the values are limited to particular values, such as when the data can only be an **integer value, from 1 to 5**.

**Continuous** data is when data could be any value within a range, such as the measurement of the **weight of a dozen eggs**, where the weight isn't limited to integers and most likely the data is rounded off to a certain significant figure.
