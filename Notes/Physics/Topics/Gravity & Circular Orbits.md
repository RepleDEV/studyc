According to **Newton's law of gravitation**, any two bodies of mass will **always** be attracted to each other, i.e., they will always have force pulling each other to one another. 
The magnitude of the force of attraction is:
* proportional to the product of the two masses and
* is inversely proportional of their distance ($r$)
$$
F_g = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}
$$
From this, we can derive a few things:
## Gravitational Potential Energy
Gravitational potential energy $U$, GPE, is defined as the total work done to move a point mass $m$ from *infinity* to a final distance $r$ from point mass $M$. Work or energy is calculated by an integral, therefore:
$$
U = \int_\infty^r{F_g}dr=\int_\infty^r{G\frac{Mm}{x^2}}=-G\frac{Mm}{r}
$$
The GPE being negative is due to the fact that it is defined as the **total work done** to move a point mass **closer** towards the isolated mass. The fact is is that work must be done to move *away* from the isolated mass since the force is attracting, i.e. is directed towards said mass. Therefore, moving the test mass *closer* to the isolated mass must be negative (alternatively it is also because there is no requirement of external force to move the test mass). Since at the reference point $\infty$ gravity will have no influence, therefore the GPE at $\infty$ must be $0$, and as $r$ decreases GPE must decrease. A decrease from $0$ is **negative**. 
## Gravitational potential
Gravitational potential $V$ at a point is defined as the work done per unit mass to move an object from *infinity* to the point.

From the definition of $U$ from earlier, we get that:
$$
V = \frac{U}{m} = -G\frac{M}{r}
$$
## Gravitational field strength
The **gravitational field strength** $g$ at a point is defined as the force per unit mass on a test mass at that point.
$$
g = \frac{F}{m} = G\frac{M}{r^2}
$$
