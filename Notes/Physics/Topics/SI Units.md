SI units are short for the **International System of Units**, an internationally agreed system of units that is built on seven base units.
## Base units
The foundation for SI units are **SI base units**.
* second (symbol **s**) to measure **time**
* metre (symbol **m**) to measure **length**
* kilogram (symbol **kg**) to measure **mass**
* ampere (symbol **A**) to measure **electric current**
* kelvin (symbol **K**) to measure **temperature**
* mole (symbol **mol**) to measure the **amount** of **chemical substances**
* candela (symbol **cd**) to measure **luminous intensity**

## Derived units
All derived units are a combination of products or quotients of the 7 base units listed above.

## Homogeneity of equations
Units in equations follow homogeneous rules, which means that every term of an equation have exactly the same unit. In other words, given an equation:
$$
A + B = P\times Q
$$
Therefore, $A$, $B$, and $(P\times Q)$ all must have the same units.
## Prefixes
Prefixes indicate multiples or submultiples of units (like how **centimetres** are a hundredth of a **metre**).
