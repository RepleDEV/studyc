Waves are oscillating disturbances over a medium. This can range from [[Electromagnetic Waves]], water waves, to sound waves.
## Anatomy
With waves, it has a **velocity**, i.e., the speed of travel of the wave. Its velocity is proportional to its **wavelength** and its **frequency**. Its wavelength is, as the name suggests, the length of **one** of its wave, with its frequency quantifies the number of waves per a unit of time. 
$$
v=\lambda f
$$
In a wave, it has an amplitude, i.e., its largest displacement. Intensity is another quantity that is proportional to the amplitude.
$$
I \propto A^2
$$
Waves can be categorized into two types, **progressive** and **stationary**. 
* **Progressive**: are waves that transfer energy from point A to B
* **Stationary**: waves with localized energy
## Progressive Waves
Progressive waves carry energy along their path with a visible travelling motion.

There are two types of progressive waves:
* **Transverse**: where its particles move **perpendicular** to the travel of energy
* **Longitudinal**: where its particles move **parallel** to the travel of energy
## Stationary Waves
Stationary waves are waves created by the **superposition** of two progressive waves, i.e., the addition of two progressive waves. A pair of progressive waves with opposing directions, with the same frequency and wavelength will create a progressive wave, given that their **phase difference** is **not** $\frac{(2n + 1)\pi}{2}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.
