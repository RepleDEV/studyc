Waves are oscillating disturbances over a medium. This can range from water waves, to sound waves, a vibrating string, etc.
## Anatomy
With waves, it has a **velocity**, i.e., the speed of travel of the wave. Its velocity is proportional to its **wavelength** and its **frequency**. Its wavelength $\lambda$ is, as the name suggests, the length of **one** of its wave, with its frequency $f$ quantifies the number of waves per a unit of time. 
$$
v=\lambda f
$$
From this, we can also deduce the time it takes for one wavelength to travel, its period $T$:
$$
T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{\lambda}{v}
$$
In a wave, it has an amplitude, i.e., its largest **displacement**. Intensity is another quantity that is proportional to the amplitude.
$$
I = \frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Area}} \propto A^2
$$
Waves can be categorized into two types, **progressive** and **stationary**:
## Progressive Waves
Progressive waves carry energy along their path with a visible travelling motion.

There are two types of progressive waves:
* **Transverse**: where its particles move **perpendicular** to the travel of energy
* **Longitudinal**: where its particles move **parallel** to the travel of energy
## Stationary Waves
Stationary waves or standing waves are waves created by the **superposition** of two progressive waves, i.e., the addition of two progressive waves. A pair of progressive waves with opposing directions, with the same frequency and wavelength will create a stationary wave with a maximum amplitude of the sum of the amplitudes of the superposed waves.

Notice that some particles stay in place while others move to its maximum amplitude. Particles that do not move are called **nodes** while particles that reach the amplitude is called an **antinode**. A consequence of this is that stationary waves do not carry energy along its path and its energy stays within the wave (assuming no energy loss).

The formation of stationary waves can also be done from a single wave source which reflects back into itself in its medium. Such stationary waves follow these conditions for the boundaries of the medium:
* fixed boundaries form **nodes** as at these points the particles must not move
* free boundaries form **antinodes** and has maximum displacement

For stationary waves to form, its wavelength must follow a multiple of the medium's length as it follows the two boundary conditions.
## Doppler effect
When a sound wave is moving towards or away from the observer, the observed frequency of the sound will be different than its source frequency. When the source is moving towards the observer, the perceived frequency will be higher than its source frequency. On the other hand, if the source is moving away, the frequency will be lower.

This effect, called the doppler effect, is expressed by this relationship:
$$
\frac{f_o}{f_s}=\frac{v}{v \pm v_s}
$$
Where:
* $f_o$: frequency at the observer
* $f_s$: frequency at the source
* $v$: speed of sound
* $v_s$: speed of the source relative to the observer
## Interference & Coherence
Two waves are **coherent** when they have a fixed **phase difference**. Phase difference $\phi$ (radians) is a measure on how apart the two waves are in its cycle. 

Two coherent waves, when they meet, will interfere with each other. The two waves will either add up to form a wave with amplitude of the sum of the two waves' amplitudes. This is called **constructive** interference. This happens when the phase difference of the two waves are whole multiples.
$$
\phi=n\times2\pi, \space n\in \mathbb{Z}_{}
$$
**Destructive** interference is a consequence when the two waves are "out of phase", and they cancel each other's amplitudes. This is when the phase difference is:
$$
\phi = \frac{n}{2} \times 2\pi, \space n\in \mathbb{Z}
$$

## Diffraction
Diffraction is an interference caused by waves through a small slit or *aperture*. When a wave goes through an aperture it bends around it, spreading, diffracting away.
### Double-slit interference
When waves travel through a double slit, each slit diffracting the wave and effectively acts as a radial wave source. These two diffracted waves meet and **interfere** with each other, creating an **interference pattern**. This pattern is described as having a maxima (bright fringe) in the middle, with successive, equidistant dark and bright fringes throughout.

This pattern is described in the relationship:
### Diffraction grating
A wave may go through a diffraction grating where it would diffract at many parts throughout of the diffraction grating. The many waves also interfere and create an interference pattern.

## Interference patterns
The two interference patterns described earlier can be described using these two relationships:
$$
d\sin\theta = n\lambda, \space n = \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots
$$
Where:
* $d$ is the width of each slit 
	* or distance between the two slits for the double-slit experiment
* $\theta$ is the angle of the diffraction
* $n$ is the $n$'th maxima (bright fringe)
* $\lambda$ is the wavelength

For the double-slit experiment only:
$$
\lambda = \frac{ax}{D}
$$
Where:
* $a$ is the distance between the two slits
* $x$ is the distance between fringes
* $D$ is the distance between the slit and the screen
