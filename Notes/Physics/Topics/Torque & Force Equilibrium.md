**Torque**, or the **moment of force** is the effect of force in a **rotating body**, and it is equal to the product of the **force** and the **distance** from the force applied to the center of rotation, also known as the pivot.
$$
\tau=rF
$$
* $\tau$: torque
* $r$: distance from force to pivot
* $F$: [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Dynamics|force]]
## Torque Couple
A couple is defined as a pair of forces that act in opposite directions that results in the body to rotate around its pivot.
## Torque Equilibrium
When a rotating body is in equilibrium, the **resultant** torque will be $0$. In other words, the torque going **clockwise** will be **equal** to the torque going **anticlockwise**. This is known as the **principle of moments**.
$$
\tau_{\ce{cw}} = \tau_\ce{acw}
$$
## Force equilibrium
If an object is acted on by more than one force, for it to be equilibrium, the **resultant** of the force [[vectors]] must be zero.
$$
\text{equilibrium: }\sum \vec{F} = 0
$$

> In A-Levels, force equilibrium usually involves 2 to 3 *coplanar* force vectors. Refer to the summations of vectors.
