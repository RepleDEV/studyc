The kinematics of circular motion describes the motion of systems with rotation, such as a wheel. The kinematics of circular motion can be used to describe the *linear speed* of a rotating wheel. All equations circle around $\omega$, representing the **rate of change** of the rotating wheel's angle.
$$
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$
Given the equation for [[Circular Measure#Arc|arc length]], we can see that the distance traveled of $s$ of $\theta$ is given as:
$$
s(\theta) = r\theta
$$
To find velocity we can conclude that:
$$
\frac{ds}{dt} = v=\frac{ds}{d\theta} \cdot \frac{d\theta}{dt} = r\omega
$$
For acceleration, it is important to understand that for *linear* circular motion, the acceleration only changes the **direction** of the velocity. For an object that moves in circular motion, it can be visualized that the *velocity* is a [[Notes/Math/Topics/Vectors|vector]] that spins around tangentially. The acceleration is defined as:
$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r
$$
