An electromagnetic [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Waves|wave]], or EM wave, is a wave made up of a moving, oscillating **electric** and **magnetic** field, which are oscillating perpendicular to each other, and are both perpendicular to the electromagnetic wave's direction of travel. Electromagnetic waves are always **transverse** waves, however, they are a wave of energy which does not require a medium to travel.

Electromagnetic waves travel (in a vacuum, but, generally) at the speed of light, $c$, where it is roughly equal to:
$$
c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ ms}^{-1}
$$
## Polarization
EM waves could be either **polarized** or **unpolarized**. Polarized waves are only oscillating at a **specific angle**. Unpolarized light can be polarized using a polarizing filter, and polarized light can be repolarized or absorbed completely using the same filter.
### Polarizing filters
When a polarized light passes through a polarizing filter, its **intensity** will be absorbed by a factor of $\cos^2(\theta)$ of the angle of the polarized light relative to the angle of the polarized filter. Polarized waves will be polarized to the angle of the polarizing filter.

EM Waves oscillate up and down. If we take one wave at one specific time where the wave has maximum displacement, we can think of the wave as a vector angled at $\theta$ (relative to the filter) with length of its amplitude $A$. 

For example, consider a wave of amplitude $A$ of $1$ and an angle $\theta$ of $30^\circ$ to the horizontal (relative to the filter). The amount of the wave that will pass through will be the horizontal component of the wave, $A_f = A_i \times \cos(30^\circ)$. Because the intensity of a wave is proportional to the **square** of its amplitude, we get:
$$
I_f = I_i \times \cos^2(30^\circ)
$$
More generally:
$$
I_f = I_i\times\cos^2(\theta)
$$
### Polarizing filter on unpolarized waves
On unpolarized waves, the waves will pass through and be polarized to the direction of the polarized filter. The intensity of the wave will be decreased by **half** of its original intensity.
## Diffraction
Electromagnetic waves when passing through a tiny slit or aperture goes through a phenomenon called **diffraction**, in that the waves *diffract* outwards after passing through the slit. The tinier the slit, the more the waves diffract.
