**Torque**, or the **moment of force** is the effect of force in a **rotating body**, and it is equal to the product of the **force** and the **distance** from the force applied to the center of rotation, also known as the pivot.
$$
\tau=rF
$$
* $\tau$: torque
* $r$: distance from force to pivot
* $F$: [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Dynamics|force]]
## Torque Couple
A couple is defined as a pair of forces that act in opposite directions that results in the body to rotate around its pivot.
## Torque Equilibrium
When a rotating body is in equilibrium, the **resultant** torque will be $0$. In other words, the torque going **clockwise** will be **equal** to the torque going **anticlockwise**.
$$
\tau_{\ce{cw}} = \tau_\ce{acw}
$$
