The **dynamics** of a **system** of objects are the properties of such objects that affects their interactions with each other, such as:
* mass
* acceleration
* force
* inertia
* momentum
## Newton's laws of motion
1. A body will remain at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a **straight** line unless a force is acted upon it.
2. Force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration, or the rate at which momentum is changing over time: $F = ma$
3. An equal but opposite reaction occurs when two bodies exert forces on each other.
## Momentum
Momentum is formally defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity:
$$
\pmb{p} = m\pmb{v} 
$$
Newton's second law states that:
$$
\pmb{F}=\frac{d\pmb{p}}{dt}
$$
Given that $m$, mass is constant, we get that:
$$
\frac{d\pmb{p}}{dt} = m\frac{d\pmb{v}}{dt}=m\pmb{a}
$$
## Impulse
Impulse is defined as the change in momentum of an object. 
$$
\Delta \pmb{p} = \pmb{J}
$$
Given that force is the rate of change of momentum over time, with a constant force, we get that:
$$
\pmb{F} = \frac{\Delta \pmb{p}}{\Delta t}
$$
Therefore, we can conclude that the impulse, or change in momentum of an object with constant force $\pmb{F}$, is:
$$
\pmb{J} = \Delta \pmb{p}=\pmb{F}\Delta t
$$
With a varying force:
$$
\pmb{J} = \int \pmb{F}dt
$$
## Conservation of momentum
Momentum is always conserved in collisions, given no external forces acting upon the objects, denoted as:
$$
m_1v_1 + m_2v_2=m_1v_1^`+m_2v_2^`
$$
However, with the object's [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Energy|kinetic energy]], only **elastic collisions** conserve their kinetic energy.
$$
KE_1+KE_2 = KE_1^`+KE_2^`
$$
### Inelastic Collisions
In an inelastic collision, or a sticky collision, is a type of collision where the two objects "*stick*" to each other after the collision. For this, the final velocity of the two objects are the same.
$$
m_1v_1 + m_2v_2=(m_1+m_2)v_f
$$
## Equilibrium
When an object is in equilibrium, it is defined to have a net force of $0$. The sum of any forces, or lack thereof must equal zero. 
$$
\Sigma\pmb{F} = 0
$$
This applies to both one dimensional forces, and vector forces.
## Variety of forces
In life, there are many forces that can be acted upon any mundane object. For example, in a moving car, there's a **pushing** force that moves the car forwards, there's also **drag** from the air molecules that counteract that movement, the **weight** of the car from **gravity**, which can result in **friction**, etc.
## Contact force
Contact force is the force that results from objects touching one another, like if a box is being **pushed** or the contact force from an object's **weight** touching the ground.
## Tension force
Tension force is the force that runs along the length of a string, rope, or anything along those lines.
## Normal force
Normal force is the force that counteracts the force of **weight**, which is an equal opposite force following Newton's **third law of motion**.
