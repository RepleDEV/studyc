The **dynamics** of a **system** of objects are the properties of such objects that affects their interactions with each other, such as:
* mass
* acceleration
* force
* inertia
* momentum
## Newton's laws of motion
1. A body will remain at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a **straight** line unless a force is acted upon it.
2. An object's rate of change of momentum is proportional to the resultant force on it.
3. An equal but opposite reaction occurs when two bodies exert forces on each other.
## Momentum
Momentum is formally defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity:
$$
\pmb{p} = m\pmb{v} 
$$
Newton's second law simplifies to:
$$
\pmb{F}=\frac{d\pmb{p}}{dt}
$$
Given that $m$, mass is constant, we get that:
$$
\frac{d\pmb{p}}{dt} = m\frac{d\pmb{v}}{dt}=m\pmb{a}
$$
## Impulse
Impulse is defined as the change in momentum of an object. 
$$
\Delta \pmb{p} = \pmb{J}
$$
Given that force is the rate of change of momentum over time, with a constant force, we get that:
$$
\pmb{F} = \frac{\Delta \pmb{p}}{\Delta t}
$$
Therefore, we can conclude that the impulse, or change in momentum of an object with constant force $\pmb{F}$, is:
$$
\pmb{J} = \Delta \pmb{p}=\pmb{F}\Delta t
$$
With a varying force:
$$
\pmb{J} = \int \pmb{F}dt
$$
## Conservation of momentum
Momentum is always conserved in collisions, given no external forces acting upon the objects, denoted as:
$$
m_1v_1 + m_2v_2=m_1v_1^`+m_2v_2^`
$$
However, with the object's [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Energy|kinetic energy]], only **elastic collisions** conserve their kinetic energy.
$$
KE_1+KE_2 = KE_1^`+KE_2^`
$$
### Inelastic Collisions
In an inelastic collision, as most collisions occur as, **lose some of the initial kinetic energy** during collision. However, momentum is still conserved.

In a **perfectly** inelastic collision, or a sticky collision, is a type of collision where the two objects "*stick*" to each other after the collision. For this, the final velocity of the two objects are the same.
$$
m_1v_1 + m_2v_2=(m_1+m_2)v_f
$$
## Equilibrium
When an object is in equilibrium, it is defined to have a net force of $0$. The sum of any forces, or lack thereof must equal zero. 
$$
\Sigma\pmb{F} = 0
$$
This applies to both one dimensional forces, and vector forces.
## Variety of forces
In life, there are many forces that can be acted upon any mundane object. For example, in a moving car, there's a **pushing** force that moves the car forwards, there's also **drag** from the air molecules that counteract that movement, the **weight** of the car from **gravity**, which can result in **friction**, etc.
## Contact force
Contact force is the force that results from objects touching one another, like if a box is being **pushed** or the contact force from an object's **weight** touching the ground.
## Tension force
Tension force is the force that runs along the length of a string, rope, or anything along those lines.
## Normal force
Normal force is the force that counteracts the force of **weight**, which is an equal opposite force following Newton's **third law of motion**.
