The **dynamics** of a **system** of objects are the properties of such objects that affects their interactions with each other, such as:
* mass
* acceleration
* force
* inertia
* momentum
### Precursors
The equation for force from Newton's law of motion is:
$$
F=ma
$$
This will be applied to systems of objects, but since we're dealing with (possibly) more than one object, and more than one force being applied at once, the equation becomes:
$$
\Sigma F = \Sigma ma
$$
Here, the **sum** of forces, $\Sigma F$ is known as the **resultant** force. 
## Variety of forces
In life, there are many forces that can be acted upon any mundane object. For example, in a moving car, there's a **pushing** force that moves the car forwards, there's also **drag** from the air molecules that counteract that movement, the **weight** of the car from **gravity**, which can result in **friction**, etc.
## Contact force
Contact force is the force that results from objects touching one another, like if a box is being **pushed** or the contact force from an object's **weight** touching the ground.
## Tension force
Tension force is the force that runs along the length of a string, rope
