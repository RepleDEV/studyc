An electric field is a vector field of a region in space in which charged particles experience forces. For a small positively charged particle ${q}$ experiencing a force $F$ within an electric field, its *electric field strength* $E$ at a point is defined as the force per unit charge, namely:
$$
E = \frac{F}{q}
$$
For an isolated, **positively** charged particle the electric field generated from it will be radially *outwards* from the charged particle, however for a **negatively** charged particle, the field will be radially *inwards*. Consequentially, when two oppositely charged particles are placed in close proximity, they will be attracted towards each other. Meanwhile, for same charged particles, they will repel each other.

## Uniform Electric Fields
A uniform electric field can be created by having two parallel plates with a **potential difference** across them.

For two metal plates that are a distance $d$ apart with a potential difference of $V$ between them, when a charge of $+Q$ moves from the positively charged plate to the negatively charged plate, the [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Energy|work done]] $W$ on the charge is:
$$
W=Fd=QV
$$
From here, the electric field strength $E$ can be found as:
$$
E=\frac{F}{Q}=\frac{V}{d}
$$
$E$ can also be rewritten to be:
$$
E=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}
$$
## Coulomb's Law
Coulomb's law takes a similar form to the force of [[Gravity & Circular Orbits|Gravity & Circular Orbits]] to define the force between two point charges in free space. Coulomb's law states that if two **point charges** with charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are at a distance $r$ apart, the force between them is:
$$
F = k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
$$
Where $k_e$ is the coulomb's constant, or constant of proportionality, defined as:
$$
k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}
$$
Where $\varepsilon_0$ is the *electric permittivity* in a vacuum.

Revising the electric field strength formula, we get the strength for an isolated particle charged $q$ at a distance $r$:
$$
E = k_e\frac{q}{r^2}
$$
## Electric Potential Energy
The electric potential energy at a point is defined as the work done to move a **unit positive charge** from infinity to that point.
$$
U_E(r) = -\int_\infty^r F\space ds=k_e\frac{qQ}{r}
$$
## Electric Potential
Electric potential or the electric field potential is the amount of energy required per unit of electric charge to move it from a reference point to a specific point in an electric field.
$$
V_E(r) = \frac{U_E(r)}{q}=k_e\frac{Q}{r}
$$
