A magnetic field is a **field of force** produced by moving charges or by permanent magnets.

## Magnetic Force on a Moving Charged Particle
Given a particle with charge $q$ travelling at velocity $\vec{v}$ travelling through a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$, then the force $\vec{F_{B}}$ acting on it is defined as:
$$
\vec{F_{B}} = q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}
$$
