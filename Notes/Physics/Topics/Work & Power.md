Work is defined as the product of force and displacement (for which said displacement is parallel to the direction of force).
$$
W = Fs
$$
Work also represents the quantity of energy that is put into a system through applying **force** across a **distance**.

## Power
Power is defined as the rate of change of power.
$$
P = \frac{W}{t} = Fv
$$
