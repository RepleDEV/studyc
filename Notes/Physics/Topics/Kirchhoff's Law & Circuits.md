When it comes to [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Electricity & Resistivity|electrical]] circuits, there are two main current types: **D.C** or direct current and **A.C** or alternating current. 
## Electromotive Force
The electromotive force (e.m.f.) of a power source is essentially the voltage generated (energy per charge delivered) in an open circuit. Essentially, the voltage generated when no current is flowing.
### Internal Resistance
In a power source, nothing is perfect, therefore there will always be internal resistance within it. When connected to a circuit, the measured voltage between the two terminals will be slightly lower than its e.m.f. due to the internal resistance.
