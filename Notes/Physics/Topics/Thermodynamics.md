Thermodynamics is the study of internal energy and its behaviors. The laws of thermodynamics define temperature as the **average internal kinetic energy** of the atoms of an object, i.e., how much the atoms inside an object vibrate and collide with each other. 
### Heat transfer
When two objects with a difference in temperature touch, energy transfer occurs. Energy flows from the object with higher internal energy (higher temperature) to the lower one until they reach **thermal equilibrium**, where they both have the same temperature, and energy transfer no longer happens.
## Temperature scales
In the real world temperatures are usually recorded in these three scales:
* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin
These three temperature scales have different ways of dictating what "0 degrees" is for them, also known as their *reference points*. Celsius and fahrenheit have both of their reference points on the freezing and boiling points of water. Kelvin is the only temperature scale that is not referenced on a physical property of a substance, also known as the **absolute** temperature scale.
* Celsius:
	* $0^{\circ}C$  = Freezing point of water
	* $100^{\circ}C$ = Boiling point of water (at 1 atm pressure)
* Fahrenheit
	* $32^{\circ}F$ = Freezing point of water
	* $212^{\circ}F$ = Boiling point of water (at 1 atm pressure)
* Kelvin
	* $0^{\circ}K$ is defined as **absolute zero** where there is no movement of the particles of an object, i.e. no internal energy.

> [!warning] Thermometers
> Internal energy itself is impossible to measure directly, therefore thermometers use indirect methods of measuring temperature by measuring various properties that change as temperature changes, such as:
> * expansion of a liquid (such as with mercury thermometers)
> * change in electrical resistance
> * change of electrical resistance of a thermistor
> * change in the voltage output of a thermocouple
> * change in pressure of a fixed volume of gas
## Specific heat capacity
The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined as **the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the substance by 1 degree celsius**.
$$
Q = mc\Delta T
$$
Where:
* $Q$ is the heat energy
* $m$ is the mass
* $c$ specific heat capacity
* $\Delta T$ change in temperature
## Specific latent heat
Specific latent heat $L$ is the energy required to change a substance's state without changing its temperature. There are two specific latent heats:
* **fusion**: between liquid and solid
* **vaporisation**: between gas and liquid

$$
Q = mL
