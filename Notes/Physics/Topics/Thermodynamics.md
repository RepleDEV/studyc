Thermodynamics is the study of internal energy and its behaviors. The laws of thermodynamics define temperature as the **average internal kinetic energy** of the atoms of an object, i.e., how much the atoms inside an object vibrate and collide with each other. 
### Heat transfer
When two objects with a difference in temperature touch, energy transfer occurs. Energy flows from the object with higher internal energy (higher temperature) to the lower one until they reach **thermal equilibrium**, where they both have the same temperature, and energy transfer no longer happens.
## Temperature scales
In the real world temperatures are usually recorded in these three scales:
* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin
These three temperature scales have different ways of dictating what "0 degrees" is for them, also known as their *reference points*. Celsius and fahrenheit have both of their reference points on the freezing and boiling points of water. Kelvin is the only temperature scale that is not referenced on a physical property of a substance, also known as the **absolute** temperature scale.
* Celsius:
	* $0^{\circ}C$  = Freezing point of water
	* $100^{\circ}C$ = Boiling point of water (at 1 atm pressure)
* Fahrenheit
	* $32^{\circ}F$ = Freezing point of water
	* $212^{\circ}F$ = Boiling point of water (at 1 atm pressure)
* Kelvin
	* $0^{\circ}K$ is defined as **absolute zero** where there is no movement of the particles of an object, i.e. no internal energy.
	* $275.16^{\circ}K$ is defined by the triple point of water.

> [!warning] Thermometers
> Internal energy itself is impossible to measure directly, therefore thermometers use indirect methods of measuring temperature by measuring various properties that change as temperature changes (known as thermoelectric properties), such as:
> * expansion of a liquid (such as with mercury thermometers)
> * change in electrical resistance
> * change of electrical resistance of a thermistor
> * change in the voltage output of a thermocouple
> * change in pressure of a fixed volume of gas
## Specific heat capacity
The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined as **the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the substance by 1 degree celsius**.
$$
Q = mc\Delta T
$$
Where:
* $Q$ is the heat energy
* $m$ is the mass
* $c$ specific heat capacity
* $\Delta T$ change in temperature
## Specific latent heat
Specific latent heat $L$ is the energy required to change 1 kg of a substance's state without changing its temperature. There are two specific latent heats:
* **fusion**: between liquid and solid
* **vaporisation**: between gas and liquid

$$
Q = mL
