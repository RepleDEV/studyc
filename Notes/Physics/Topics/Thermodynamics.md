Thermodynamics is the study of **internal energy** and its behaviors. Internal energy is determined by the state of the system, also known as a **state function**.
## First law of thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics states the principle of **conservation of energy**, where, energy cannot be destroyed nor created. Mathematically, this is expressed as the internal energy change ($\Delta U$) equalling to the sum of the heat transferred to the system ($q$) and the work done on the system ($W$).
$$
\Delta U = q + W
$$
The work done on the system, at constant pressure, is defined as:
$$
W = p\Delta V
$$
Where, if the volume $V$ decreases, work has been done **on** the system, and $W$ is positive. If $V$ increases, work has been done **by** the system, and $W$ is negative.
## Heat transfer
When two objects with a difference in temperature touch, energy transfer occurs. Energy flows from the object with higher internal energy (higher temperature) to the lower one until they reach **thermal equilibrium**, where they both have the same temperature, and energy transfer no longer happens.
## Temperature scales
In the real world temperatures are usually recorded in these three scales:
* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin
These three temperature scales have different ways of dictating what "0 degrees" is for them, also known as their *reference points*. Celsius and fahrenheit have both of their reference points on the freezing and boiling points of water. Kelvin is the only temperature scale that is not referenced on a physical property of a substance, also known as the **absolute** temperature scale or **thermodynamic temperature**.
* Celsius:
	* $0^{\circ}C$  = Freezing point of water
	* $100^{\circ}C$ = Boiling point of water (at 1 atm pressure)
* Fahrenheit
	* $32^{\circ}F$ = Freezing point of water
	* $212^{\circ}F$ = Boiling point of water (at 1 atm pressure)
* Kelvin
	* $0^{\circ}K$ is defined as **absolute zero** where there is no movement of the particles of an object, i.e. no internal energy.
	* $275.16^{\circ}K$ is defined by the triple point of water.

> [!warning] Thermometers
> Internal energy itself is impossible to measure directly, therefore thermometers use indirect methods of measuring temperature by measuring various properties that change as temperature changes (known as **thermometric** properties), such as:
> * expansion of a liquid (such as with mercury thermometers)
> * change in electrical resistance
> * change of electrical resistance of a thermistor
> * change in the e.m.f. output of a thermocouple
> * change in pressure of a fixed volume of gas
## Specific heat capacity
The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined as **the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the substance by 1 degree celsius**.
$$
Q = mc\Delta T
$$
Where:
* $Q$ is the heat energy
* $m$ is the mass
* $c$ specific heat capacity
* $\Delta T$ change in temperature
## Specific latent heat
Specific latent heat $L$ is the energy required to change 1 kg of a substance's state without changing its temperature. There are two specific latent heats:
* **fusion**: between liquid and solid
* **vaporisation**: between gas and liquid

$$
Q = mL
