Electricity is the concept of the flow of energy through the exchange of **electrons**. As per the atom's anatomy in [[Atoms]], electrons hold **negative** charge, with its flow invoking an [[Electromagnetic Waves|electromagnetic wave]] which carries energy.
## Electrons
Given a power source, with ends repelling and attracting electrons, having a positive and negative end. Its negative end repels electrons, with its positive end attracting them.

This way, electrons "flow" through a circuit, transferring energy in the process.
## Charge
Each electron has its own charge, given in the units of **coulombs**. One single electron has a charge of roughly: $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \space \text{C}$, also known as the **elementary charge**. The total charge in a circuit is equal to the product of the number of electrons and the elementary charge constant.
## Current
Current is the rate of charge over time, defined as:
$$
I = \frac{Q}{t}
$$
The consensus with charge is that it flows from the **positive** to the **negative** end, in opposing directions to the flow of electrons, with the idea of a power cell's *negative* terminal putting out *negative*ly charged electrons which are attracted to the positive terminal.
## Potential Difference
Potential difference, otherwise known as voltage, is defined as the difference of the amount of energy carried by a charge between two points, given by the equation:
$$
V=\frac{W}{Q}
$$
This could then be intuitively understood as the amount of energy carried per unit of charge for a given voltage.
## Drift Velocity
Drift velocity measures the average velocity of the flow of electrons through a circuit, given by the equality:
$$
I = Anvq
$$
Where:
* $I$: current
* $A$: cross-sectional area of the medium (such as a wire)
* $n$: number of electrons per unit of volume
* $v$: drift velocity
* $q$: elementary charge

# Resistivity
Each material has its own **resistivity**, namely, its *resistance* to the flow of electrons. Resistance is measured in **ohms** ($\ohm$). Ohm's law connects resistance with current and voltage giving the equation:
$$
V = IR
$$
Through the equations for current and voltage, the equation for **power**, or the rate of energy transfer can be derived.
$$
\begin{align*}
V&=\frac{W}{Q}\\
&=\frac{W}{It}\\
VI&=\frac{W}{t}\\
{P} &= VI
\end{align*}
$$
Using ohm's law, two more equations can be derived, which is used to calculate the power dissipated in a given resistive element, such as a resistor:
$$
P =\frac{V^2}{R}=I^2R
$$
## Material Resistivity ($\rho$)
A material's resistance is proportional to its *resistivity*, given in the equation:
$$
R = \rho\frac{L}{A}
$$
Where:
* $R$: resistance
* $\rho$: resistivity
* $L$: length of the material
* $A$: cross-sectional area of the material perpendicular to its length.
