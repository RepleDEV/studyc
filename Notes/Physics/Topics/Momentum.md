While force is the product of mass and acceleration, **momentum** is the product of mass and **velocity**. 

While momentum can be difficult to conceptualize, it is used to calculate the speed and direction of colliding objects.
## Conservation of momentum
Momentum is conserved in a perfectly elastic collision, i.e., if two objects collide, the sum of their momentum will **not change** after the collision.
$$
m_1v_1 + m_2v_2=m_1v_1^`+m_2v2^`
$$
This property is also true for the objects' kinetic energy.
$$
\begin{align*}
KE &= \frac{1}{2}mv\\
KE_1+KE_2 &= KE_1^`+KE_2^`
\end{align*}
$$
### Perfectly Inelastic Collision
In a perfectly inelastic collision, or a sticky collision, is a type of collision where the two objects "*stick*" to each other after the collision. For this, the final velocity of the two objects are the same.
$$
m_1v_1 + m_2v_2=(m_1+m_2)v_f
$$
## Impulse
Impulse is the change of momentum in an object. The change of momentum in an object is in terms of the **applied force** and the **contact time**, $\Delta t$.
$$
\Delta p = F \Delta t
$$
## Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions
In this case, it's about a collision with a moving ball with a stationary one. After their collision, both balls will be redirected with an angle $\theta_n$ relative to the path of the first ball. In this case, the **vector sums** of the two balls' momentums after the collision must equal to the vector of the first ball's momentum.
$$
\vec{p_1}=\vec{p_1^`}+\vec{p_2^`}
$$
