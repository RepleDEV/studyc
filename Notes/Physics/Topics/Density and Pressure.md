**Density** is defined as **how much** a material is per its given volume. Formally:
$$
\rho=\frac{m}{V}
$$
**Pressure** is defined as how much [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Dynamics|force]] is exerted over a given area.
$$
p=\frac{F}{A}
$$
When it comes to pressure, the direction of force that it is acted on is always perpendicular to the surface area it's acting upon. This is due to the fact that pressure is actually calculated using the *normal* force.

Using **pascals** as the unit, defined as $N$ (newtons, **force**) per $m^2$ (area).
$$
\text{Pa} = \frac{N}{m^2}=\text{kgm}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2}
$$
## Hydrostatic Pressure
From these two equations, we can derive the equations for **hydrostatic pressure**, known as the pressure an object experiences under a **fluid** (also known as buoyancy force).

Consider an object being submerged in water. The object would experience pressure from the water above it. The water above it would have weight:
$$
W=mg
$$
We can get the water's mass using the water's density and the column of water above the object:
$$
m=\rho V
$$
Since the water is **above** the object, at a depth of $h$, and cross-sectional area $A$ of the object, its volume would be equal to $V = hA$.

Substituting:
$$
\begin{align*}
p &= \frac{W}{A}\\
&=\frac{\rho Vg}{A} = \frac{\rho hAg}{A}\\
&=\rho gh
\end{align*}
$$
## Archimedes' principle
Archimedes' principle states that with an object resting in a fluid there's an upwards buoyancy force acting upon it.

Given that in any object there is hydrostatic pressure pushing **down** from above, and pushing **up** from below, we can calculate the difference in the two pressures as:
$$
\Delta p = \rho g \Delta h
$$
Where $\Delta h$ is equal to the height difference between the top and bottom of the object.

These two pressures contribute to the **buoyant force** to the object:
$$
\begin{align*}
F &= \Delta p\times A \\
&= \rho g \Delta h\times A \\
&= \rho g V
\end{align*}
$$
Where $V$ is equal to the volume of the object submerged.
