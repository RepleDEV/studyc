**Density** is defined as **how much** a material is per its given volume. Formally:
$$
\rho=\frac{m}{V}
$$
**Pressure** is defined as how much **force** is exerted over a given area.
$$
P=\frac{F}{A}
$$
Using **pascals** as the unit, defined as $N$ (newtons, **force**) per $m^2$ (area).
$$
\text{Pa} = \frac{N}{m^2}=\text{kgm}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2}
$$
## Hydrostatic Pressure
From these two equations, we can derive the equations for **hydrostatic pressure**, known as the pressure an object experiences under a **fluid** (also known as buoyancy force).

Imagine an object being submerged in water. The object would experience pressure from the water above it. The water above it would have weight:
$$
F_{w}=mg
$$
We can derive the water's mass from the density formula earlier:
$$
m=\rho V
$$
and finally, using the pressure equation:
$$
\begin{align*}
F_u &= \frac{F_w}{A}\\
&=\frac{\rho Vg}{A}\\
&=\rho gh
\end{align*}
$$
