Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by *radiation*. The three most common radioactive decays are: alpha, beta, and gamma decay.
## Alpha Decay
Alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay where an atomic nucleus emits an *alpha particle* (helium nucleus). An alpha particle is identical to a **helium-4** isotope, but with a charge of $+2e$. An example of alpha decay is:
$$
\ce{^{226}_{88}Ra -> ^222_86Rn + ^4_2He + energy}
$$
