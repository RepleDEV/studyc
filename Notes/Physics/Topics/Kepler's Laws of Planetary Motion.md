Keppler's laws are a collection of three laws which describes the motion of planetary orbits around the sun. 
## 1st Law: The Law of Orbits
Kepler's first law states that planetary orbits are all moving in [[Ellipses|elliptical]] orbits, with the sun as the focus. The elliptical orbits are a result of the *inverse-square* relationship between distance and [[Gravity & Circular Orbits|gravitational]] force.
## 2nd Law: The Law of Equal Area
A planet orbiting a sun sweeps an equal amount of area between the sun and its orbit, given equal time intervals, regardless of the planet's position.
