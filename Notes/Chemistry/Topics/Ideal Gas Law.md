This chapter is further elaborated in [[Ideal Gases & Kinetic Theory of Gases]].

The **ideal gas law** states that under the same temperature, pressure, and volume, all gases contain the same number of molecules.
$$
pV=nRT
$$
* $P$: pressure (in **pascal**)
* $V$: volume (in $m^3$)
* $n$: number of moles
* $R$: Gas constant, $R = 8.3145 \space JK^{-1} \text{mol}^{-1}$ 
* $T$: Temperature (in **kelvin**)
