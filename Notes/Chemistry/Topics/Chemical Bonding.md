Chemical bonding describes how atoms and molecules stick (bond) with each other. There are several types of chemical bonding which include:
* **Ionic bonding**: electrostatic attraction between ions
* **Covalent bonding**: bonds formed from the sharing of valence electrons of two atoms

These chemical bonds require a lot of energy to break. Bonds between molecules on the other hand are comparatively weak, these are called **intermolecular forces**. 
* *van der Waals'* forces
* permanent *dipole-dipole* forces
* hydrogen bonds
