The unit for atomic mass: **atomic mass units**, is measured relative to one twelfth of a **carbon-12** atom. A **carbon-12** atom has a total of 12 particles in its nuclei (sum of protons and neutrons), each are measured to be **one** atomic mass units. 

So the **relative** atomic mass of a **carbon-12** atom is (roughly) 12 u (12 atomic mass units).

It is only a rough estimate because the masses for atoms are measured according to their isotopic abundance.
