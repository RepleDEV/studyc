A mole is a unit which describes a set quantity of atoms per given mole. 1 mole of an element or compound is defined as **Avogadro's constant** ($\ce{N_a}$) number of said element/compounds.

Avogadro's constant is defined as:
$$
6.022 \times 10^{23}
$$
and so, for example, **a mole** of hydrogen equals to $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ hydrogen atoms.
## Compounds
For chemical compounds, each element in that compound follows the mole count of the compound itself multiplied by how much of said element in the compound. For example, the compound $\ce{H2O}$, one mole of $\ce{H2O}$ will have **two** moles of **hydrogen** and **one** mole of **oxygen**.
## Molar volumes
The volume of any number of moles at STP (standard temperature pressure), will be the number of moles times 22.4.
$$
V = n(22.4)
$$
For RTP:
$$
V = n(24)
