When electrons orbit an atom's nuclei, they have their own **orbitals** and **shells**, like how planets orbit the sun in a solar system. Except, with atoms, more than one electron can fit in a single shell. Electron shells grow farther from the nuclei the higher the shell number.

>**Electron shells** also represent the atom's **energy level**
## Subshells
Within each shell, electrons are grouped by **subshells**, which can only fit a limited amount of electrons.
There are four* subshells, each with their own orbital amounts, but, each orbital can only fit two electrons.
* **S subshell**: subshell with **one** orbital, which can fit two electrons
* **P subshell**: subshell with **three** orbitals, which can fit 6 electrons
* **D subshell**: subshell with **five** orbitals, which can fit 10 electrons
* **F subshell**: subshell with **7** orbitals, which can fit 14 electrons.
## Electron filling
When an electron is an added to an electron, it does so with a specific pattern. **A Hydrogen atom (Z=1)**, an element with **one** electron, has the electron placed in the **first shell**, and in the **S** subshell. Then, if we add an electron to it, like with **Helium (Z=2)**, the second electron also goes to the **S** subshell. Next, we have **Lithium (Z=3)**, the third electron will be placed in the **second** shell, but also in the **S** subshell. So is with the fourth electron. For five electrons, the fifth electron will be in the **P** subshell of the **second** shell. And this goes on until the **P** subshell is filled entirely, then it goes back to the **S** subshell of the next shell.

It is all nice and tidy until we get to the **fourth** shell. After the **S** subshell is filled, the next electron will instead fill the **third** shell, but in the **D** subshell. And it will do so** until the **D** subshell is filled. After that, the **4P** subshell will be filled.

This "filling order" is called the **Aufbau principle**, and it follows this graph:

## Writing Electron Configurations
Writing electron configurations uses this notation:
$$
\ce{1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^4}
$$
Here, we have the electron configuration for **Oxygen (Z=8)**. The letters represent the subshells, the number preceding them is the **energy level**, and the superscript number is the amount of electrons in that particular subshell. 
### Noble gas notation
Writing electron configurations that way may be acceptable for the first few electrons but with anything more than a dozen electrons will get very long to write. Instead, the **noble gas** notation can be used.

Noble gases are elements with all of their electron shells completely filled. In the periodic table, it is all of the elements in the far right. And any element with a higher energy level than any noble gas, can use the previous noble gas to notate their electron configuration.
$$
\ce{[Ar] 4s^{2} 3d^2}
$$
Here, we have the element **Titanium (Z=22)** and it used **Argon (Z=18)** to notate its electron configuration. 
## Removing electrons
When removing electrons, like when ionizing an atom, the order of removal from the outmost shell and inwards. So with the titanium element, for $\ce{Ti+}$ the electron removed will be from the $\ce{4s}$ subshell.
