Ionization energy is the energy required to remove the **outermost** electron of a **gaseous** atom. 

It is expressed as:
$$
\ce{Z(g)->Z(g)^{+} + e^{-}}
$$
where $\ce{Z}$ is any atom or molecule and $\ce{Z^+}$ is the resultant ion and $\ce{e^-}$ is the removed electron.

When ionizing an electron, the first ionization energy of the elements in the periodic table has a general pattern to it. The higher the period of an element the
