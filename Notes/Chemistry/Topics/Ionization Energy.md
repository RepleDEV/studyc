Ionization energy is the energy required to remove the **outermost** electron of a **gaseous** atom. 

It is expressed as:
$$
\ce{Z(g)->Z(g)^{+} + e^{-}}
$$
where $\ce{Z}$ is any atom, $\ce{Z^+}$ is the resultant ion and $\ce{e^-}$ is the removed electron. The $\text{g}$ in parentheses denotes the fact that element $\ce{Z}$ has to be in its **gaseous** form for it to be ionized.

When ionizing an electron, the first ionization energy of the elements in the periodic table has a general pattern to it. The higher the period and/or group of an element, generally, the first ionization energy will get higher.
## Changes in an element's ionization energy
Several factors are involved when it comes to the first ionization energies of elements. 

The less the atomic number, the less electrons there are that are orbiting the nucleus, as such, the outermost electron will be much closer to the nucleus, which would be experiencing a stronger pull from the protons in the nucleus, making it harder to ionize. As energy levels rise, the outermost electron will be orbiting **farther** from the nucleus, making it easier for the electron to be removed.
