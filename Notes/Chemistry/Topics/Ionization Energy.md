Ionization energy is the energy required to remove the **outermost** electron of a **gaseous** atom. 

It is expressed as:
$$
\ce{Z(g)->Z(g)^{+} + e^{-}}
$$
where $\ce{Z}$ is any atom, $\ce{Z^+}$ is the resultant ion and $\ce{e^-}$ is the removed electron. The $\text{g}$ in parentheses denotes the fact that element $\ce{Z}$ has to be in its **gaseous** form for it to be ionized.

When ionizing an electron, the first ionization energy of the elements in the periodic table has a general pattern to it. The higher the period and/or group of an element, generally, the first ionization energy will get higher.
