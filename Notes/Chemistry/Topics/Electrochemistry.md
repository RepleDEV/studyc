Electrochemistry is the study of electricity and how it relates to chemistry. The most prominent use of electrochemistry is the invention of batteries, where through electrolysis and [[Notes/Chemistry/Topics/Redox Reactions|Redox Reactions]], [[Notes/Physics/Topics/Electricity & Resistivity|Electricity]] is generated.
## Electrolysis
The main purpose of electrolysis is to use electricity to cause a chemical reaction. Specifically, a **redox** reaction. It uses an **electrolytic cell**, which uses **direct current** connected to two *electrodes* which are dipped into an *electrolyte*. 
### Electrolyte
The *electrolyte* is a compound that is decomposed during electrolysis. Definitions of an electrolyte vary immensely, of which they include, but are not limited to:
* a substance that conducts electricity through the movement of ions ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte)).
