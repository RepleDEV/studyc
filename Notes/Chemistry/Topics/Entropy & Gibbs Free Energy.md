## Entropy
Entropy is a concept associated with the measure of a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty.
## Entropy in chemical reactions
The entropy change in a reaction can be expressed as:
$$
\Delta S_\text{total} = \Delta S_\text{system} + \Delta S_\text{surroundings}
$$
In a system it can be expressed as:
$$
\Delta S_\text{system} = \Delta S_\text{products} - \Delta S_\text{reactants}
$$
With the entropy change of the surroundings being:
$$
\Delta S_\text{surroundings} = -\frac{\Delta H}{T}
$$
## Gibbs Free Energy
The entropy change relates to the *Gibbs free energy* through the equation:
$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S_\text{system}
$$
Here, $\Delta H$ is the change in enthalpy of a system.
