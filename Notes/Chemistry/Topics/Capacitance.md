Capacitance is the capability of an object to hold electric charge. One such object is a capacitor, with its capacitance relating to the equation:
$$
C=\frac{q}{V}
$$
## Capacitors
Capacitors usually hold electric charge by using two parallel plates. Both plates having equal charges stored on each plate, one plate having a positive charge of $+q$, the other having an equal negative charge of $-q$. 

For two connected capacitors, since one plate, lets say, having a negative charge of $-q$, would also induce a charge of $+q$ on the opposite end of the wire, which would be at one end of another capacitor. 
## Capacitors in series 
For capacitors in parallel, we can see that the voltages ($v$) of all capacitors add up to the e.m.f. of the power source ($E$).
$$
E = \sum v
$$
Since $V = \frac{q}{C}$, therefore:
$$
\frac{q}{C_\text{total}} = \sum\frac{q}{C}
$$
Since all charges of series capacitors are equal, therefore:
$$
\frac{1}{C_\text{total}}=\sum\frac{1}{C}
$$
