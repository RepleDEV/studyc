Functional groups of organic compounds are a way of organizing organic compounds depending on their chemical structure and arrangement.
## Alkanes
Alkanes are recognized by their carbon-carbon single bonds (C-C), with each carbon atom also connected to three **hydrogen** atoms.

They have a chemical formula of $\ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}$, they are non polar and flammable, such as any other hydrocarbon.

## Naming Alkanes
The first step to naming any organic compound is to find and name the longest continuous carbon chain. Each length of carbon chain has its own prefix:

| 1    | 2   | 3    | 4   | 5    | 6   | 7    | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| ---- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| Meth | Eth | Prop | But | Pent | Hex | Hept | Oct | Non | Dec |
