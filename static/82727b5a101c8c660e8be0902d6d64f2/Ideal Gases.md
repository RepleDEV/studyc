An ideal gas describes a gas in which all collisions between the atoms or molecules are perfectly elastic and there are no intermolecular forces. Such gases obey the relationship between pressure $p$, volume $V$, and temperature $T$, described as:
$$
pV = nRT
$$
where:
* $n$ is the number of [[Notes/Chemistry/Topics/Moles|moles]] in the gas itself
* $R$ is the molar gas constant
