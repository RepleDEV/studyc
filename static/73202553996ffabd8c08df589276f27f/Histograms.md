Histograms look similar to bar charts, but histograms serve a very different purpose to bar charts. Histograms show frequency distribution within a set of data, like, for example:

This is a histogram showing an image's color distribution with the x-axis with the far left being black and the far right being white, and the heights of the graph representing **how much** of that color exists in the image.
## Graphing Histograms
One must note that most histograms are shown from data showing frequency of specific intervals, as such, drawing histograms is often as simple as drawing rectangles with widths representing these intervals and heights being the frequencies.
