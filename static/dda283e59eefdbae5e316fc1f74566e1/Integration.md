Integration is the method of reversing the process of differentiation. Where differentiation finds the slope of a function at a given point, integration gives the area under the function, given a set of boundaries.
## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
The first fundamental theorem of calculus defines the **antiderivative**. Given a function $f$ that is continuous over the interval $[a,b]$, and $F$ be defined for all $x$ in $[a,b]$, by:
$$
F(x) = \int_a^x{f(t) \space dt}
$$
Then, $F'(x) = f(x)$. For all $x$ in $(a, b)$, $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$.

This theorem is then used in the **second part** of the theorem, saying that:
$$
\int_a^b f(x)\space dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$
