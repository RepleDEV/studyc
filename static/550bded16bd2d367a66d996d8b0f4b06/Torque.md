**Torque**, or the **moment of force** is the effect of force in a **rotating body**, and it is equal to the product of the **force** and the **distance** from the force applied to the center of rotation.
$$
\tau=rF
$$
## Torque Equilibrium
When a rotating body is in equilibrium, the **resultant** torque will be $0$. In other words, the torque going **clockwise** will be **equal** to the torque going **anticlockwise**.
