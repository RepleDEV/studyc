Reversible reactions are reactions go both ways, in which the products itself also yields the original reactants.  This way, the maximum yield cannot be achieved as new reactants are always being created using up the products to do so. 

An example of this is the reaction to create **ammonia**.
$$
\ce{N2 + 3H2 <=> 2NH3}
$$

Reversible reactions are dynamic, in which they are continuously reacting with each other to create each other. The reactions react at the same rate in both directions, and once enough time has passed the reaction will reach equilibrium in which the concentrations of both products and reactants are constant.

Once equilibrium is reached, the reaction's [[Equilibrium Constant]] could be calculated (and vice versa).
## Changing Reaction Context
In a reversible reaction, when more reactant is added to a reaction, the equilibrium will shift to the right (to product), the opposite is true when product is added.
