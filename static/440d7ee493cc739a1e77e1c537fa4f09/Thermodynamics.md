Thermodynamics is the study of internal energy and its behaviors. The laws of thermodynamics define temperature as the **average internal kinetic energy** of the atoms of an object, i.e., how much the atoms inside an object vibrate and collide with each other. 
### Heat transfer
When two objects with a difference in temperature touch, energy transfer occurs. Energy flows from the object with higher internal energy (higher temperature) to the lower one until they reach **thermal equilibrium**, where they both have the same temperature, and energy transfer no longer happens.
## Temperature scales
In the real world temperatures are usually recorded in these three scales:
* Celsius
* Fahrenheit
* Kelvin
These three temperature scales have different ways of dictating what "0 degrees" is for them, also known as their *reference points*. Celsius and fahrenheit have both of their reference points on the freezing and boiling points of water. Kelvin is the only temperature scale that is not referenced on a physical property of a substance, also known as the **absolute** temperature scale.
* Celsius:
	* $0^{\circ}C$  = Freezing point of water
	* $100^{\circ}C$ = Boiling point of water (at 1 atm pressure)
* Fahrenheit
	* $32^{\circ}F$ = Freezing point of water
	* $212^{\circ}F$ = Boiling point of water (at 1 atm pressure)
* Kelvin
	* $0^{\circ}K$ is defined as **absolute zero** where there is no movement of the particles of an object, i.e. no internal energy.
