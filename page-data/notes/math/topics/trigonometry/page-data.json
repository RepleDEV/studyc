In other words:\n$$\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{b}{h}$$\nWhich means that given any right triangle with a known hypotenuse and a known angle, the two other sides could be deduced.\n$$b = \\sin(\\theta)\\times h$$\nTo find $a$, the **cosine** of $\\theta$ must be used.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos(\\theta) &= \\frac{a}{h}\\\\\na &= \\cos(\\theta)\\times h\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n## Unit circle\nAnother way (arguably an easier way) of thinking about trigonometric functions is with a [[unit circle]]. \n![[Pasted image 20230807094926.png]]\nGiven a circle with radius of $1$, the point $P$ that sits on the circle with angle $\\theta$ relative to the center of the circle, will be equal to $(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta))$.\n\nNotice how the $cos$ and $sin$ coordinates form a right triangle, with the radius being the hypotenuse.\n\nThe tangent ($tan$) function is defined as the ratio of the **opposite** side to the **adjacent side** to an angle of a right triangle. Knowing the the unit circle, it would be:\n$$\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}$$\nWith $\\sin$ being the $y$ coordinate and $cos$ being the $x$ coordinate, using the definition of a [[slope]], $\\tan(\\theta)$ is equals to the **slope** of a straight line with angle $\\theta$. \n>[!warning]\n>If you see the unit circle again, the **tangent** of the circle at angles $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{2\\pi}$, it will be a vertical line, for which a slope for a vertical line is **undefined**. Which means that the **tangent** of $0$ and $\\pi$ is **undefined**.\n## Related angles\nFor any angle $\\theta$ in the first quadrant, there exists an equivalent angle in the second quadrant where the **sine** of said angle is equal to $\\sin(\\theta)$, and it is the **mirror angle** of $\\theta$ (angle reflected across the **x-axis**).\n![[Pasted image 20230906122737.png]]\n$$\n\\sin(\\theta)=\\sin(\\pi-\\theta)\n$$\nIf the same two angles are reflected across the **y-axis** it will be equal to the negative of the sine of $\\theta$.\n$$\n\\sin(\\theta)=-\\sin(2\\pi-\\theta)\n$$\nFor **cosine**, it is reversed.\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta)=\\cos(2\\pi-\\theta)=-\\cos(\\pi-\\theta)\n$$\nLastly, for **tangent**, the slope of the tangent at any point $P$ that sits on a circle, will be equal the point that is in the other side of $P$. Which means that, the angle $\\theta$ must be reflected in **both** the **y-axis** and the **x-axis**.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Reflect across the $x$-axis:}&= \\tan(\\pi-\\theta)\\\\\n\\text{Reflect across the $y$-axis:}&= \\tan(2\\pi-(\\pi-\\theta))\\\\\n\\tan(\\theta)&= \\tan(\\pi+\\theta)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n## Inverse functions\nTrigonometric functions also have their inverses, where they take the ratio of two sides as input and outputs an angle.\n* $\\arcsin$: the inverse **sine** function (also $\\sin^{-1}$)\n* $\\arccos$: the inverse **cosine** function ($\\cos^{-1}$)\n* $\\arctan$: the inverse **tangent** function ($\\tan^{-1}$)\n>[!warning]\n>Due to [[Angles#Angular equivalence|angular equivalence]], any multiple of $2\\pi$ plus the output of the inverse functions will also be correct. This is also the case for [[#Related angles]].\n>\n>Usually, angles will be reduced to within the range of $0\\leq\\theta\\leq2\\pi$ unless stated.\n## Function transformations\nTrigonometric functions are **periodic** functions, which means that they repeat their values at regular intervals. For the **sine** and **cosine** functions, the period is $2\\pi$ (for **tangent** it is $\\pi$), which means that after $2\\pi$, the output would then repeat.\n\nEvery formula works from [[Functions#Function Transformations]].\n\nFor the functions **sine** and **cosine**, the function produces a **sinusoidal** wave (sine wave), which means that **sine** and **cosine** has an **amplitude**. For $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$, the **amplitude**, is $1$, with the range being $[0,1]$. When transformed, the amplitude and/or range may change depending on the transformation.\n## Trigonometric identities\nBy seeing the unit circle once again, we could see that the circle's radius of $1$ forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with side lengths $\\sin(\\theta)$ and $\\cos(\\theta)$. By using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]], we can deduce the fact that:\n$$\n\\sin^2(\\theta)+\\cos^2(\\theta)=1\n$$\nDividing this equation by either $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ or $\\cos^2(\\theta)$ we get:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n1+\\frac{\\cos^2(\\theta)}{\\sin^2(\\theta)} &= \\frac{1}{\\sin^2(\\theta)}\\\\\n1+\\cot^2 &= \\csc^2(\\theta)\\\\\n\\cot^2(\\theta)&=\\csc^2(\\theta)-1\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n1+\\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{\\cos^2(\\theta)} &= \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(\\theta)}\\\\\n1+\\tan^2(\\theta) &= \\sec^2(\\theta)\\\\\n\\tan^2(\\theta)&=\\sec^2(\\theta)-1\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThis leads to:\n### Reciprocals of trigonometric functions\n* Reciprocal of $\\sin$: $\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\theta)}=\\csc(\\theta)$\n* Reciprocal of $\\cos$: $\\frac{1}{\\cos(\\theta)}=\\sec(\\theta)$\n* Reciprocal of $\\tan$: $\\frac{1}{\\tan(\\theta)}=\\cot(\\theta)$\n## Trigonometric formula for area of any triangle\nThe area of any triangle is half of the base times the height.\n$$\nA=\\frac{1}{2}h_b \\times b\n$$\nGiven the side lengths of the two adjacent sides to an angle of any triangle and the angle itself, we can calculate the area of said triangle.\n![[Pasted image 20230814201703.png]]\nHere, we can see that if we draw a perpendicular line $h_b$ of $b$ that goes through a corner of the triangle, it divides the triangle into two right triangles. \n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nh_b&=\\sin(\\gamma)\\times a\\\\\nA&= \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\gamma)\\times a \\times b\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n## Law of Sines\nThe Law of Sines states that the ratios of the sine of the angle of any corner of a triangle to the length of the side that it's facing towards will **all** be **equal**.\n![[Pasted image 20230815083849.png]]\n$$\n\\frac{a}{\\sin(A)}=\\frac{b}{\\sin(B)}=\\frac{c}{\\sin(C)}\n$$\n### Proof\n![[Pasted image 20230815084258.png]]\nThe triangle could be divided to its two right angled triangle components sharing the side $h$. The side $h$ will be equal to the sine of the angle $C$ times side $b$, which would also be equal to the side $B$ times the side length $c$.\n$$\n\\sin(C)\\times b=\\sin(B)\\times c\n$$\nRearranging, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{\\sin(B)}=\\frac{c}{\\sin(C)}\n$$\nThis could also be done with angle $A$, giving the formula above.\n## Law of Cosines\nThe Law of Cosines is a law that **generalizes** the [[Pythagorean Theorem]], so that an equation could be used to find the sides of any triangle.\n\nFor example: given any triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$; with the respective angles that face them be $A$, $B$, and $C$; and $C < 90^\\circ$.\n![[Pasted image 20230815091539.png]]\nIf we were to plug it to the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n$$\na^2+b^2=c^2\n$$\nBut if we actually calculate it, we could see that $a^{2}+b^{2}$ is **greater** than $c^2$ and it is because $C$ is less than $90^\\circ$. We must **subtract** something from the left hand side of the equation to make it equal to $c^2$.\n![[Pasted image 20230815091954.png]]\nSay we take the perpendicular bisector of $a$ that passes through $A$. Here we can see that it forms a right triangle with sides $c$, $h$ and $a-r$ with $r$ being the adjacent side of $C$ until $h$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem we get:\n$$\nc^2 = (a-r)^2+h^2\n$$\n\nFrom this we could deduce that:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin(C)=\\frac{h}{b} &\\implies h=b\\times\\sin(C)\\\\\n\\cos(C)=\\frac{r}{b} &\\implies r=b\\times\\cos(C)\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nPlugging everything in:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nc^2 \n&= (b \\times \\sin(C))^2 + (a - b \\times \\cos(C))^2 \\\\\n&= b^2 \\times \\sin^2(C) + a^2 - 2ab \\times \\cos(C) + b^2 \\times \\cos^2(C) \\\\\n&= b^2 \\times \\big( \\sin^2(C)+ \\cos^2(C) \\big) + a^2 - 2ab \\times \\cos(C)\\\\\n&= b^2 + a^2 - 2ab \\times \\cos(C)\\\\\nc &= \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\times \\cos(C)}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n[Source](https://brilliant.org/wiki/cosine-rule/)\n> [!done] Conclusion\n> Trigonometry is the measure of circular angles and ratios of triangle side
