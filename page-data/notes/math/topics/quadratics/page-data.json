(Refer to [[Factorizing Polynomials]])\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n6x^2+11x-35&=0\\\\\n(3x+5)(2x+7)&=0\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nNow we have our factors $(3x-5)$ and $(2x+7)$. Next, we need to find the value(s) of $x$ (if any) that makes the equality true.\nNotice that **if any of the factors of the polynomial is zero**, the left side of the equation would be zero (thus making the quality true).\nFor $(3x-5)$, it would be $x = \\frac{5}{3}$. Plugging it back in:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(3\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) - 5)(2\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)+7) &= 0\\\\\n(0)(2\\frac{5}{3}+7)&=0\\\\\n0 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nAnd we're done :3\nThough that's only **one** of the **roots**. We also have to find the root to $(2x+7)$.\nSpoiler alert: it's $x = \\frac{-7}{2}$\nSo the **roots** aka the solution(s) to the quadratic equation is:\n$$\nx = \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ or } x=-\\frac{7}{2}\n$$\n## Quadratic Inequalities\nBefore solving **quadratic inequalities**, it's useful to know the \"shape\" of the curve. If the coefficient of $x^2$ is **positive**, the curve of the parabola is opening **upwards**. And if it's **negative** then it is opening **downwards**.\nThis is an **upward** parabola ($x^2$):\n![[Pasted image 20230718183722.png]]\nAnd, this is a **downward** parabola ($-x^2$):\n![[Pasted image 20230718183842.png]]\nKnowing this is important to solving the inequality as we'll see later.\n> [!warning]\n> Note the difference between $-x^2$ and $(-x)^2$. With exponents, the former reads $-(x^2)$, so the minus sign is **AFTER** the exponent.\n### Solve by factorizing\nNow, let's say we have the inequality:\n$$\nx^2-3x-4 \\geq 0\n$$\nFirst we factorize the left hand side.\n$$\n(x+1)(x-4) \\geq 0\n$$\nNow, find the solutions to where the equation is **zero**.\n* $x=-1$\n* $x=4$\nHere, the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so it's an **upward** parabola. So, the solutions would be\n$$\nx\\leq-1 \\text{ or } x\\geq4\n$$\nThe solution with a **smaller number** gets the **less than or equal** sign and vice versa.\n\nOkay, now what if the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative like in this example? (Mirrored equation from the previous one)\n$$\n(-x-1)(x-4) \\geq 0\n$$\nThis time, the solution is when $x$ is in between the two factors.\n$$\n-1\\leq x \\leq 4\n$$\n## Completing the Square\nA **quadratic** can also be expressed in the form $a(x+p)^2+q$, where $p$ and $q$ are constants. To do this, we must **\"complete the square\"** of the quadratic.\n\nIf you're asking why, hold on to that thought first until the end.\nWhat it means to **\"complete the square\"** is this: say we have an expression $x^2+bx$. Geometrically speaking, it's as if adding a square with side lengths $x$ and a rectangle with length $b$ and height $x$.\n![[Pasted image 20230718213922.png]]\nIf we rearrange $bx$, we can *sort of* make an entire square. \n![[Pasted image 20230718213956.png]]\nThere's just a tiny bit in the corner that's missing. That's where the **\"completing the square\"** part comes in.\n![[Pasted image 20230718214044.png]]\nGeometrically speaking, it quite **literally completes the square**.\n$$\n(x+\\frac{b}{2})^2\n$$\nOkay but now, since we had to add $(\\frac{b}{2})^2$ to the equation, the value would be **different**. Thus, we also have to **subtract** it from the equation to make it equal.\n$$\nx^{2} + bx=(x\\frac{b}{2})^2-(\\frac{b}{2})^2\n$$\nThis might seem like it makes it more confusing but! I swear it will look cleaner later.\nLet's do a different example.\n$$\nx^2+6x+7\n$$\nWe complete the square on $x^2+bx$ (which would be $x^2+6x$), and subtract $(\\frac{b}{2})^2$ at the end as well.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+6x+(\\frac{6}{2})^2+7-(\\frac{6}{2})^2 &=\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nNow at this point, what you might have noticed is that the first tree terms matches the **2nd degree [[Binomial Expansion]]**. Thus:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(x+\\frac{6}{2})^2+7-9&=\\\\\n(x+3)^2-2&=\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nWhat if $a \\neq 1$? It's pretty much the same thing.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n5x^2-4x-2&=0\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nFirst, divide all terms by $a$.\n$$\nx^2 - \\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{2}{5}=0\n$$\nComplete the square as usual.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 - \\frac{5}{4}x + (\\frac{5}{8})^2 - \\frac{2}{5} - (\\frac{5}{8})^2=0\\\\\n(x - \\frac{5}{4})^2 - \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{25}{64}=0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nNow, to get it to be equal to the original equation, multiply everything by $a$.\n$$\n5(x - \\frac{5}{4})^2-2 - \\frac{25}{20}=0\n$$\nNow, if you follow the variables everything turns out to be:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na(x+p)^2+q=0\\\\\np=\\frac{b}{2a},\\space q=c-\\frac{b^2}{4a}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nAnd thus, here is the reason we did all this in the first place.\n**p** here is equal to the **x-coordinate** of the **vertex** of the curve,. and **q** is the **y-coordinate**. \nHaving it in this form also makes it easy to solve for $x$.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(x+p)^2 &= -\\frac{q}{a}\\\\\nx+p &= \\pm \\sqrt{-\\frac{q}{a}}\\\\\nx&=\\pm \\sqrt{-\\frac{q}{a}}-p\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n## Vertex\nThe vertex is the *absolute extrema* of the quadratic. Which means either the **maximum** value of the curve, or the **minimum**, depending on the curve.\n* If $a$ is positive (curve opens **upwards**), the curve will have a **minimum**.\n* And if $a$ is negative, the curve will have a **maximum**.\n## Quadratic Equation\nNow, after all of that, the other way we could solve a quadratic equation is to use the **quadratic equation**, which is:\n$$\nx=\\frac{b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n$$\nUsing this formula, we ican instantly solve any quadratic equation! Assuming that the quadratic has a **real solution(s)**. How do we know that? Why are there quadratics without a **real** solution?\n![[Pasted image 20230719191149.png]]\nThis quadratic ($x^2-4x+5$) has **zero(!)** real solutions. As you can see, the **vertex**'s **y-coordinate** is greater than zero. So, the function never touches the **x-axis**, which means that there are **zero possible (real) x-values** that can solve the equation.\n\nBut, how do we know if a quadratic has any solution at all? Well, calculate its **discriminant**.\n## Discriminant\nThe discriminant tells us whether or not a quadratic has **no real solution**, only **one solution**, or **two solutions***.\n$$\nd=b^2-4ac\n$$\n\nThe example quadratic above has a discriminant of **less than zero**, which means that the quadratic has **no real solutions**. \n![[Pasted image 20230719195106.png]]\nThis quadratic ($x^2+10x+25$) has only **one solution**, and has a discriminant of **zero**. The **y-coordinate** of the vertex is **zero**, making it the only point in the curve where it touches the **x-axis**.\n![[Pasted image 20230719195232.png]]\nAnd this one has **two solutions**, so the discriminant is **greater than zero**. See how the curve intersects the **x-axis** on two points.\n> [!info]\n> To not get things flipped when it comes to discriminants, just remember that in the **quadratic formula**, the **square root** of the discriminant is used, which means that if the discriminant is negative, the solution MUST NOT be a real value.\n## Intersecting lines\nTo find the tangent of a quadratic at $x = p$, the linear equation can be substituted for $y$, giving:\n$$\nm(p)+q=ax^2+bx+c\n$$\nRearranging to quadratic form:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nm(q)+b &= ax^2+bx+c\\\\\nax^2+(b-m)x\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n> [!done] Conclusion\n> A quadratic equation is a **two-degree polynomial** in the form:\n> $$\n> ax^2+bx+c=0\n> $$\n> #### Quadratic Types\n> * If $a$ is positive, the curve opens **upwards**\n> * If otherwise, the curve opens **downwards**\n> Solving it can be done by:\n> * Factorizing\n> * Completing the Square\n> * Quadratic equation\n> #### Factorizing\n> Can quickly find solutions but is
