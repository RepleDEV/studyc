Atoms are the building blocks of our universe. It is built upon **protons**, **electrons**, and **neutrons**. The anatomy of an atom consists of a very large mass in the center, made of protons and neutrons, called the **nuclei**, with electrons **orbiting** the nuclei.

The most abundant element in the world, **[[Hydrogen]]**, has **one proton** with **one electron**. An atom with **one proton** **MUST** be a **Hydrogen** atom. The **amount** of protons an atom has defines the atom.

## Protons
Protons are **subatomic particles** that has a **charge** of **+1**.
